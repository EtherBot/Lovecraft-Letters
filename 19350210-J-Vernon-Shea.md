Dear Jehvish-Ei:—

......................... Speaking of writing—I appreciate the compliment of your suggestion that I bombard the *Atlantic* with an autobiography compiled from epistolary extracts (a damn clever way of assembling one, I'll say!), but really fear that my sense of proportion is a bit too strong to let me launch such a project. There are too damned many autobiographies as it is; & when it comes to bungling old geezers who've never done anything in particular, the line simply has to be drawn! Almost anybody could cook up a lot of childish reminiscence & nostalgic maundering with a certain amount of "charm"—but the real importance or appropriateness of such a thing depends largely upon the calibre of the person concerned. If he never did anything of moment, an atmosphere of ridiculousness hangs about any attempt to dramatise his sources, recollections, & environment. *Montes laborant; nascitur ridiculus mus!* One might as well write the pompously documented biography of a sandwich man or elevator boy in 8 volumes—I. Ancestry & Childhood; II. Education & Early Contacts; III. Period of Dime Novel & Western Cinema Influence; IV. Period of Tabloid, Pool Room, & Sex Cinema Influence; V. Friendships & Debates in the McSoak's Barroom Circle; VI. Industrial Evolution; VII. Opinions & Utterances of Maturity; Leadership in the Madison Square Bench-Warming Senate; VIII. Bibliography & Index. Ho hum .... us great men! Which reminds me that I read Comte d'Erlette's second Detective novel last autumn (*The Man On All Fours*), & guessed the solution on p. 32, I judge from your reference that you have also read his first—which is more than I've done. His third will be out some time this month. Later he hopes to arrange for the publication of his first serious book—*Place of Hawks*. He certainly is arriving on all fours in the magazines!

Regarding political matters—I still don't see any course of action *likely to be adopted* which offers any improvement over the constant experimenting of the New Deal. The old principle of *laissez-faire* capitalism is absolutely dead. It has nothing but mass starvation to offer, & would—if restored—form merely the prelude to a revolution. One of the perils of the present administration is that it will too seriously heed the pressure of the frantic plutocratic elements & swing too far to the right—thereby playing into the hands of irresponsible and incompetent radicals. What is needed, quite obviously, is something considerably to the left of the New Deal—but how in hell is such a thing ever to be achieved except by slow degrees? When a "leftist" proposal is openly made, the people get frightened & defeat it—as in California last autumn. Clearly the only practical course is to go slowly—a little at a time—& get the people used to the habit of change. Certain fixed concepts—such as the inviolability of profit & private property—must be modified & liquefied very gradually. When the first general shift toward the left is fully made, the next one will be less difficult. If the present administration cannot engineer the second step, it will naturally be replaced by one that has a better chance of doing so. The one great thing is to accomplish the needed change gradually & peacefully—avoiding the kind of violent upheaval which creates irreparable harm through the destruction of cultural values. If the Democratic party veers rightward or crystallises where it is—thus replacing the possibly defunct republican party as a reactionary force—then the next hope is some new liberal party centreing in the La Follette element in Wisconsin. If even that fails, it will be time to see what Norman Thomas, Upton Sinclair, & even the grotesque Huey Pierce Long have to offer. But in any case one may hope that the trend will stick to genuine American movements really suited to the temper of the people, & not veer into the insane Marxism of self-deluded European slave-populations. The imported Russian-Jewish radicalism of New York City is just as bad as the old Republican plutocracy against which it is arrayed. Both are nationally suicidal.

Regarding my use of the expression "three alternatives" in the political letter—I may only say that the interests of forcible & direct expression did not seem to justify a retention of the archaic limitations formerly governing the word *alternative*. While it is customary with some persons to observe the old restriction (I might myself in a thing designed for permanent preservation), I did not deem it advisable to do so when a sacrifice of force would be involved. You are of course aware that the wider application of *alternative* has been common in the best writing since 1880, & that all editions of *Webster's International* have justified it as a parallel definition since the 1890 revision. Gladstone repeatedly employed the word in its originally *incorrect* sense. The advisability of such usage depends largely on the individual case. In time, all vestiges of the original limitation will undoubtedly break down because of the strong natural pull of common sense & every-day usage in such a direction. Such a change is far more logical, & far less to be lamented, than the possible parallel change which substitutes *like* for *as.* Incidentally—I notice that in the very paragraph wherein you speak of *alternative*, you employ the word *embrasure* (which means a shallow recess containing a door or window, or else a slant-sided opening in a fortification) in its archaic & obsolete sense of *embrace* or *act of embracing* .... a usage definitely inadmissible since Elizabethan times. How come? ..............
Regarding cinemas—my attendance during the past twelvemonth has been confined to such performances as my host on various visits have dragged me to. I saw *Cleopatra*—which had excellent Roman scenes, but which was spoiled by having the Alexandrian Greek court represented as *native Egyptian* in architecture & costume. As well show the British Viceroy of India in a Hindoo turban! I saw *The Barretts of Wimpole Street* & liked it—it certainly did bring up the early, Victorian age with tremendous verisimilitude. ... And I guess my sight of *Little Women* (good 19th century atmosphere in spots) post-dates my last epistle to you. The one really first-rate thing I've seen since last February is *Don Quixote*—genuine art from start to finish, without a false note. Of the others you mention, I have seen none. Most of the films I've been taken to have been such unmitigated junk that I can't recall either their titles or performers. Last April both Morton & I dozed off to sleep at a show to which the Longstreated us! By the way—you'd have been interested in a lecture I heard last December (by Prof. S. Foster Damon of Brown—biographer of Thomas Holley Chivers) on the cinema as a separate & authentic art. This address was followed by a showing of *All Quiet*—which I was glad to see again after four years, & which impressed me even more favourably than in 1930.

................ About the pronunciation *frā'kas*—I've just found it is in Webster. To what lengths is Yankee provincialism carried! But I fancy I'll continue to say *fră-kä'*, as I always have done

................. I dropped you a card from Nantucket—but hades alive! no card could even begin to describe the archaic charm of this surviving fragment of a bygone century! Only 90 miles from this doorstep—& yet I'd never seen it before! Probably the reason for my delay was the formerly expensive steamboat service—plus the fact that I never realised its full charm till Morton described it to me last year.
