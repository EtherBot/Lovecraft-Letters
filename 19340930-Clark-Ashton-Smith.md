Gateway of the Zhirns—  
Hour of the Chanting Within.  
Sept. 30, 1934

Dear Klarkash-Ton:—

............ I used to be a hide-bound reactionary before surrounding events forced me to think—actually *think*—of the political-industrial-economic order and its inevitable trend; but nowadays I realise that the wholesale application of machinery to industry has totally destroyed the old relationships between individuals and the total amount of work to be done—so that laissez-faire capitalism has actually come to the end of its rope. There is absolutely no way in which, under the old order, more than a small fraction of the idle population can ever (even amidst the greatest commercial prosperity) be employed again—since with labour-saving machinery all the possible work of the world (including the supplying of *new* demands such as the blind reactionaries rave about) can be performed by a relatively few persons. As long as the old laissez-faire order lasts, it will never again be possible for any person to be sure of a chance to earn a livelihood, no matter how industrious and willing he may be. There will always be millions (literally not less than that) of capable men, willing and law-abiding, for whom no industrial places can be found, and whose sole alternatives under the present system will be charity or starvation. There is no getting around this. It isn't merely the alien radicals who recognise the state of things, but all the best and soberest of American thinkers from John Dewey, Stuart Chase, Glenn Frank, Gifford Pinchot, Pres. Roosevelt, etc. down. It may be said almost dogmatically that *something must be done.* The old system—and even the old kind of business "prosperity" (for a select few while others starve)—leads absolutely nowhere except to a suffering bound to breed violent and disastrous revolution ..... so that today the worst possible incendiaries are those greedy old-time Republicans who fight the New Deal with meaningless catchwords and seek to promote starvation in the interest of increased profits and more yachts for the shrewd and lucky. Only the blind grabbers and hangers-on of irresponsible private commerce are today sufficiently self-deluded to fancy that the hold order will work any more. The real question is not *whether anything is to be done*—but *what is to be done.*

And here, of course, personal opinions differ. Sonny Belknap and other dupes of European ideas want a general upheaval and a new "ideology"—a whole new set of cultural values. This, to my mind, is wasteful and disastrous; since all the real values of life flow from *cultural continuity*. My belief is that the future ought to form a sane and gradual outgrowth of the past—with no *cultural* overturn at all, and with only such economic changes as will restore to the ordinary man the certainty of being able to exchange his services for the necessaries of life. I am, therefore, diametrically opposed to communism and everything else derived from the deceptive pseudo-science of Marx and Lenin. On the other hand, I realise that analysis has revealed our need for adopting many courses which, in our complacent ignorance of yesterday,  we once ridiculed and opposed as *socialistic*. We know today that laissez-faire economics will not serve to feed all the population under a regime of mechanised industry; that work for every man no longer *naturally* exists, so that some system of artificial spreading (at the expense of private industry's profits) must be adopted to avert wholesale pauperdom and revolution. This means the strict governmental regulation of all large-scale industry and commerce; the fixing of working hours and wages; the introduction of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance—and other measures which make the old-time business pirate howl. We must have these things or blow up altogether; and it is simply frivolous and irrelevant to complain (as the dupes of the old order do) that this *purely economic* oversight forms a denial of "individual freedom" analogous to the effects of Nazism or bolshevism. Such complaints are merely the fruit of ignorance or of unpatriotic self-interest. Naturally, we do not know precisely what our unprecedented dilemma calls for. There must be infinite experimentation before we can adapt ourselves to the ultra-mechanised regime which has rushed on us unawares. It may be that private industry cannot stand the profit-reductions needed to float the nation as a whole—and in that case public ownership will have to come .... though of course this does not have to mean the inverted cultural values and silly exaltation of manual over cerebral work which the bolsheviks preach. If achieved through peaceful and gradual evolution it will involve no social overturn at all. Skilled brain work will continue to be rewarded more amply than brute stevedoring—and it will mean nothing to the general culture that the recipients of these rationally graded wages will be working for the nation instead of merely swelling the unnecessary private fortunes of a few lucky individuals. There is absolutely nothing in this probably necessary *socialism* (not *communism*) which need alarm the most socially and aesthetically conservative individual. Indeed, it argues a grotesque and un-aristocratic exaltation of mere money matters when anyone shrieks that a *purely economic* change means a change in our civilisation and traditions! The great problem is *how to start* the sort of evolution we need. It is easy to plan, but abysmally difficult to get any rational measure *actually in motion.* That is why we must go slowly and cautiously, lending our support to *anything headed in the right direction which has a real chance of adoption,* even if it does not suit us as exactly as some other plan which has less chance of adoption. The public is slow and stupid, and would never consider a plan of real boldness and intelligence all at once. They must be led away from the present impossible order by slow degrees—becoming used to contraventions of laissez-faire capitalism one at a time. The New Deal, in spite of its present internal inconsistencies and frankly experimental phases, probably represents as great a step in the right direction as could *now* command any chance of support—hence it is the one and only course now deserving endorsement by intelligent friends of America's future. As the limitations of its measures appear, one by one, the public will probably be ready to remedy them through further departures from the old order; though such departures could never be "put over" without the intermediate step as an emotional solvent. Therefore I may be counted as a friend of the present administration and a welcomer of any such rational socialism as may be needed to keep all the people employed and set the nation once more in a state of decent equilibrium.

Well—so far as I can see, Upton Sinclair is out for much the same thing. It is true that he has held some doubtful political ideas in the past—but are these ideas any more absurd, or even *as* absurd, as the suicidal opposite fallacies harboured by Mr. Hoover and the "respectable" business world? Moreover, he has modified many of these ideas under the impact of existing realities. Nor was he *ever* a communist or disciple of extreme European radicalism. He always had his own sort of socialistic thought, stemming from our normal hereditary sources. ... Therefore, I believe I'd vote for Sinclair (diametrically as I disagree with his theories of aesthetics, and little as I think of his novels) if I were a Californian. I can't see anything Russian in his 100% Anglo-Saxon descendant of Virginia gentlemen—and I believe that he has moved towards middle-course reality from *his* direction as decidedly as I have moved towards it from *my* opposite direction. A decade ago I thought he ought to be chloroformed—today I prtobably hold largely the same general views that he holds. Such are the mutations and ironies of time and Growth!

Well—as you see, I surely have become a premier Hodgson fan! Do you know anything about W. H. H. and his career? Koenig tells me he was killed in the war. All told, I believe that nobody but Blackwood can equal or surpass him in capturing the exact shades of the cosmic horror mood in all their actual details. But he was uneven—again like Blackwood. *Carnacki* is very weak, artificial, and stereotyped as a whole despite the strong points which you justly point out—and the *Glen Carrig* certainly suffered a letdown halfway through. As soon as the castaways have dwelt on the island long enough to become tangible realities employing obvious siege strategy, something of the story's original tension and sense of malign expectancy is lost. Also—the attempt to use 18th century English rings absurdly false to any sincere devotee of the 18th century. I agree about *The Ghost Pirates*—and what a wealth of technical sea lore it contains! I wonder if Hodgson was ever a sailor? But the masterpiece, so far as I can see, is *The House on the Borderland*. Boy—that dim, brooding air of menace! And that stupefying cosmic sweep! I am all on edge to read *The Night Land*. ...
