Dear Mr. Anger:—

.... Regarding the dreaded *Necronomicon* of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred—I must confess that both the evil volume & the accursed author are fictitious creatures of my own—as are the malign entities of Azathott, Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, &c. Tsathoggua & the *Book of Eibon* are inventions of Clark Ashton Smith, while Friedrich von Junzt & his monstrous *Unaussprechlichen Kulten* originated in the fertile brain of Robert E. Howard. For the fun of building up a convincing cycle of synthetic folklore, all of our gang frequently allude to the pet daemons of the others—thus Smith uses my Yog-Sothoth, while I use his Tsathoggua. Also, I sometimes insert a devil or two of my own tales I revise or ghost-write for professional clients. Thus our black pantheon acquires an extensive publicity & psuedo-authoritativeness it would not otherwise get. We never, however, try to put it across as an actual hoax; but always carefully explain to enquirers that it is 100% fiction. In order to avoid ambiguity in my references to the *Necronomicon* I have drawn up a brief synopsis of its 'history'—the supposed dates of the original writing (under the Arabic title *Al Azif*), of its translation into Greek as Nεκρόνόμἰκών by the Byzantine monk Theodorus Philetas, &c, &c. All this gives it a sort of air of verisimilitude. .....

Yrs most cordially & sincerely,  
H. P. Lovecraft
