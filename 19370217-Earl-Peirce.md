Dear Mr. Peirce:—

............  
Glad you like *At the Mountains of Madness*, although the text of the *Astounding* version is nearly ruined—especially toward the end—by the inept mangling of Street & Smith's obtuse editors. I wish I could get the correct version printed as a book, but there is very little chance of such. I've had uniform bad luck with book propositions. Again and again publishers have approached me concerning a collection of tales, but negotiations have always fallen through in the end. The one approximation to a book which did get printed—*The Shadow over Innsmouth*—such a typographical mess that I hate to think about it.

.....

Yours most sincerely,  
H. P. Lovecraft  
P. S. Pardon delay in letter. After 2 months of half-illness—intestinal grippe and allied ailments—I'm down at last. Doc is dosing me with 3 different nostrums—and up only a little while at a time. I shall have to curtail all my activities for the rest of the winter.
