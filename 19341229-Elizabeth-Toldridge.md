Dear Miss Toldridge:—

................ Glad little Bobby Barlow has been dropping in. he mentioend in a note how much he enjoyed his calls. His photographic work is surely remarkable in the extreme. Has he shewn you any of his reproductions of Howard Wandrei's weird drawings? Indeed, he is astonishingly clever in every way—drawing, painting, clay modelling, writing & general craftsmanship. His bookbinding jobs—in which he sometimes uses the skins of snakes he has shot—are masterpieces in their way. .............

Yes—the gang surely are migratory by nature. Donald Wandrei has been out to California visiting Clark Ashton Smith, & is now in New York again—for how long, I am not yet certain. price is still in Oakland, & is thinking—at the moment—of buying a lot in San Carlos (south of San Fransisco in San Mateo Co., east of the bay) & building a very cheap house on it. If you still receive the *Fantasy Fan* you've doubtlessly noticed the interview with Price. (if not, I can send you recent issues—one dedicated to me.) .................

Early this month I attended an unusual number of lectures—closely grouped together as part of the local observance of "Art Week". One of them was a demonstration of painting by two of the cty's foremost artists—a landscapist & portraitist—who executed a picture apiece in full view of the audience. It was really a fascinating thing to watch. Another feature was a display of the choicest of the 717 Japanese prints just acquired by the local museum. As you know, these things form quite a hobby with me—& I enjoyed the exhibit enormously. This acquisition puts Providence more or less in the running with Boston, whose museum of Fine Arts specialises in Japanese art. Still another "Art Week" feature was an exhibition of the new aesthetic form—the correlation of shifting projected colours with music. It must have been highly interesting, but I had to forego it—since the weather was too cold to permit of my going out. ........
My aunt & I had an exceptionally pleasant Christmas, & I hope the same is true of yourself. We hjad a *tree* for the first time in over a quarter century. All our old-time tree ornaments were long ago dispersed; but I laid in a new & inexpensive stock at Woolworth's & Kresge's—tinsel star & rope, globular baubles, set of lights, stand, & abundant shreds of tinsel to hang from the branches like the Spanish moss of the far south. The result was really delightful & impressive, & I've spent considerable time admiring & gloating. We had numerous though inexpensive presents—my best one from my aunt being a picture of the oldest house in Providence (the Stephen Hopkins house—1742—only a block & a half from our door), drawn by a local artist & simply framed. We began the day most auspiciously by listening to the great British Empire broadcast—which I hope you did not miss. Etheric conversations between London & the uttermost reaches of our Dominions—Australia, Canada, India, South Africa, & so on—with other area sages from Scotland, Ireland, Liverpool, & a country place in the Cotswolds ... & finally an address by the King. I don't know when I've ever had a greater imaginative stimulus. After it was over I turned face down the dollar bill that was tied on top of one of my gifts ...... I couldn't bear to see the features of one who was instrumental in the cruel tearing of these colonies from the Empire in whose fabrick they rightly belong! Later in the day came a turkey feast at the boarding-house across the back garden (home of the late Sam Perkins), a general unveiling of gifts, & a session of conversation & contemplation by candlelight & tree-light. At the boarding-house Mrs. Spotty (little Sam Perkins's mother) received a catnip mouse as a Christmas gift, & seemed very well pleased with that traditional feline delicacy. I couldn't locate any of the members of Kappa Alpha Tau—the weather being inauspicious for sessions atop fence & clubhouse—but trust they all partook of ample Yuletide cheer.

Well—unless something goes wrong, the New York convention season will open Monday morning—the last day of 1934. Barlow hit the metropolis Christmas Day, & is staying at a rather luxurious hotel in 102nd St. which Long found for him. His tastes in lodging are so sumptuous & sybaritical that he couldn't get about the country as cheaply as I do! He & Long find each other tremendously congenial, as I knew they would. On Thursday Wandrei put in his appearance—& tomorrow night I shall myself take a stage coach for Manhattan, arriving at the Long headquarters in time for breakfast. It certainly ought to be quite a gathering—with other local gang-members likewise on hand. Don't know how long I'll stay—probably a week or more. The weather will be a troublesome factor, but in N. Y. the subway system forms a convenient way of getting around without much exposure. Barlow has not seen N. Y. sicne his infancy, so that all the museums, bookshops, &c., will be new to him. Doubtless Long will be taking him about this week—& whgat he doesn't show him, I will next week. ..........
