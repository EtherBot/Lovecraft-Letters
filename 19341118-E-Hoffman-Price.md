Dear Malik:—

Your remarks on phantasy in general, and on the quality of my attempts therein, proved most interesting and encouraging. Definitions of real weirdness or phantasy are almost impossible to establish. All one can say is that the weird tale or poem must form an authentic crystalisation or objectivisation of some deep and geuine human mood connected with the illusion of unseen worlds and the revolt of the emotions against the limitations of time, space, and natural law. ..

.. What I am looking for is the best way to illustrate and embody the moods and vision which demand to be set down, and as yet I frankly don't know what that way is. All my knowledge is purely *negative*. I have learned a few things *not to do*, but which of the countless remaining courses is the best one to follow .... or whether *more than one* ought, on diverse occasions, to be followed .... I have really not the slightest idea. All is experimental. I have a feeling that many typical features still persisting in my tales belong in the category of things not to be done, but so far I've not been able to discover what they are. When I do, I'll drop them overboard. One point concerns an occasional plethora of *visibly explanatory matter*. I feel sure that I ought to get rid of this—to substitute *brief implication or suggestion*—but at this stage I don't know how to make the substitution. Another point is the conveyance of shades of mood, and the presentation of events, in such a way as to give a full-bodied picture and *justify* the central weird assumption or climax .... that is, make this assumption or climax seem quasi-real or emotionally important rather than trivial, irrelevant, and unmotivated. At this stage I am unable to accomplish such a purpose without plenty of space for detail and "building-up". A better artist might do it through brief but potent symbolism or suggestion—but if I try that, the result is thin and hollow. Just now I am experimenting with an old plot idea of mine which I may have described to you—that of a man who, in excavating ruins palpably of incredible antiquity, comes upon (as an unmistakable part of them) *a specimen of his own handwriting in English*. The explanation is that these ruins belong to a pre-human race of organic entities, infinitely above man in mental powers, who in their day ranged the whole gamut of time through mental transference. To learn of a future age, they would have one of their number project his mind ahead and displace the consciousness of somebody in the chosen period. Then the voyaging mind in the body of its victim, would absorb all the information possible—and finally fly back through time to its original body, while the displaced mind had occupied the body of the pre-human voyager, hence had had a brief life and consciousness in the immemorial past. And of course it could then leave a *record* which, in its proper body millions of years later, it could discover during the excavation of blasphemously ancient megalithic ruins. Well—I developed that story *mistily and allusively* in 16 pages, but it was no go. Thin and unconvincing, with the climactic revelation wholly unjustified by the hash of visions preceding it. So I've torn the whole damn thing up and am re-writing it in my usual latter style—with gradual hints and slowly built-up stages of unfolding. Am now on page 27, and fear it will run to 40 before I'm through. Naturally, I know what the majority will say—if I decide to type it and show it around. "Verbose—long-winded—slow—nothing happens—novelette length for short-story idea—etc., etc., etc." But the fact remains that it represents the best I can do with the given idea. The shorter treatment was wholly inadequate—not even scratching the surface of the many bizarre implications involved in the central assumption. And so it goes. Possibly I'll never succeed in what I'm slowly fumbling f or, but only experiment will decide.
