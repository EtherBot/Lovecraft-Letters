598 Angell St., Providence, R.I., February 3, 1924,

My dear Baird:-

I was delighted to receive your two communications, and to hear that you like "Nemesis". This delight atones fairly well for the sensation of gastric depression caused by the implication that "Arthur Jermyn" is going to press as "The White Ape"! I wish I could convert you to my point of view re- garding the annoying literalness and flaccidity of that latter title....but all I can do is say that it is the one title which I could never possibly have applied to that particular tale; that it is at war with the spirit and internal harmonies of the narrative, and clashes fearsomely with the effect of the opening paragraph. One thing---you may be sure that if I ever entitled a story "The White Ape", <u>there would be no ape in it</u>. There would be something at first taken for an ape, which would not be an ape. But how can one ever get those subtleties across?...At any rate, I know I am partly to blame for this, since I voluntarily offered to shorten the original title to "Arthur Jermyn". Now, however, after seeing just what a feeling of melancholy that un-Lovecraftian caption has given me, I am returning to my original resolve that my titles must be considered as integral with the tales, and the whole rejected unless. the titles also are pre- served. The weakening in this case was my own, but it wasn't worth while! Thanks prodigiously for the proofreading offer, of which I shall avail myself with the utmost avidity despite the laboriousness of the process, Ambrose Bierce hated proofreading, and used to complain of the bother in letters to Samuel Loveman. He read proof for the Neale edition of his collected works. Glad that "Hypnos" is coming. Are you giving me a vacation for March, or are the "Rats" to gnaw their uncanny course through that issue?

Yes indeed, I have heard from Mr. Henneberger! Cheque? Bless me, no! Such details are so vulgar! But I am told that the twin ventures DETECTIVE and WEIRD TALES have reduced the Hennebergian capital from plus eleven thousand to minus forty thousand; hence presume that I ought to be a very meek and inaudible minus... if minus there be in a matter of aesthetics. Henneberger seems determined to hang on to his venture till the last ditch, and shows a rugged pluck I can't but admire, He spoke of a coming reorganisation to include work from the magician Houdini and the elaboration of gruesome crime material at the expense of fiction, reducing the latter to a novel and two or three short stories per issue. I can't say that this strikes me as following the Machen or Poe tradition in art (unless Marie Roget is a keynote in Poe), but if it increases circulation and saves the magazine from annihilation, who shall quarrel too arbitrarily? At any rate, Henneberger has the right idea in savage unrestraint and departure from the conventional point of view....I'll bet he'd snap up that Eddy yarn, "The Loved Dead", which is presenting such a doubtful case! But I should hardly say that H. made me any “proposition”, as he intimated to you he might. The only part of his letter that brought me in was a request for a novel of 25,000 words or over, which I shall be happy to send when I finish it. I've nothing of that length complete, but after trying serial stuff for HOME BREW I experimented a bit with the novel form, and have an idea partly shaped which will probably suit Mr. H.'s requirements. It is a hideous thing whose pro- visional title (subject to change) is "The House of the Worm". All this apart from my big novel idea---"Azathoth"---which will be exotic and highbrow, and wholly un- suited to WEIRD TALES. By the way, I felt complimented when Henneberger expressed his opinion that my "Rats" is the best tale W.T. ever received! I wish he'd tell sister Bob Davis that!

H's curiosity about my age, habits, and personality is quite interesting..... taste, I suppose, of what I should encounter if I were a celebrity! Have you read Dunsany's "Fame and the Poet"? I vastly admire Dunsany. I must wite my autobiog- raphy some day....every mediocre, uninteresting person of late seems absolutely determined to write his autobiography, especially if he has done nothing whatsoever to warrant it. I must be pompous and colourful, and supply the element of dramatic interest where life has failed to supply it....helas! Lifelong indolence and nearly lifelong ill-health have made my annals as short and simple as those of the class who subsist on W.T. cheques! Une vie celebrale----nothing more, if even that!

Howard Phillips Lovecraft was born on August 20, 1890, in a large Victorian house in Providence, set on a terrace amidst expansive shady grounds, and close to the fields of what was then the edge of the settled district. His ancestry was that of unmixed English gentry; quite directly on the paternal side, where his own grandfather had left Devonshire as a poorish younger son and sought fortune in the state of New York, and in a Yankeefied way maternally, his emigrant ancestor being the Reverand George Phillips, who came from Norfolk in 16350 with Mr. Winthrop's colony, buried his first wife in Salem in the same year, and finally settled in Watertown, rearing a numerous posterity and earning from Cotton Mather the not un- fulsome epitaph: Hic Jacet GEORGIUS PHILLIPPI, Vir Incomparabllis, nisi SAMUELUM genuisset". It is the cankering sorrow of my life, that I am descended through another son than the more than incomparable Samuel! At an early age--an age of very few months, in fact--the future master of literature emigrated to the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay, taking his parents with him on account of a desire of his father's to transact business---commonplace thought---in the village of Boston. It was here that first contacts with literary people were established; for as a pro- visional residence the young philosopher chose that of a friend of his mother whose name is not unknown to fame, but whose finances made co-operative living a very useful expedient at that period---I refer to the late poetess Louise Imogen Guiney. Oliver: Wendell Holmes came not infrequently to this menage, and on one occasion (unremembered by the passenger) is said to have ridden the future WEIRD TALES dis- ciple on his venerable knee, But such a career of promise was not for long. At the time, indeed, young Lovecraft shewed signs of considerable literary progress. Ever a nervous child, he began linguistic experiments at shortly after 1, knew his Anglo-Roman alphabet at 2, and at 2.5 was wont to astonish the Suburban throng (for the Guiney castle was at Auburndale, 11 miles from Mr. Bulfinch's aureate dome whereon the cosmos rotates) with poetic recitations from the dizzy eminence of a table's top. In 1893, however, his father's health passed into the decline from which it never emerged; so that Lovecraft and his mother returned to Providence, to that materno-grandpaternal roof at 454 Angell St. under which he originally beheld the solar illumination. But what was tragedy for the elder generation was nothing of the sort to the younger. The future dictatod of literature was intensely attach- ed to his grandfather, whose travels in Europe and taste for Italian art made him a varied and piquant converser, and to the whole place with its trees and terraces, fountains and stavles, walks and gardens---and best of all, its proximity to the ~ dreaming fields and mystic groves of antique New-England (now solid blocks of homes and apartment-houses) which the young sage's vibrant imagination peopled with every conceivable sort of unreal presence. Within the house was a vast array of books--- the fusion of two hereditary libraries---and to this the rising aesthete turned when, at four, the ars legendi became his. By a curious twist of taste, only old-fashion'd things and fantastic things attracted the infant marvel. Save for vivid tales of faery, and dark whisperings of the nether world, he would read nothing without the "long f", fo that his Tafte became compleatly that of the 18th Century, and his firft Writing (or rather hand printing), perform'd at the Age of five, (Script came at the age of seven) hath this felffame long f as its moft falient Characteriftic. The child was weak, nervous, and inclined to keep his own company after he found his voluble conversation disrelish'd by those gentlemen of his grandfather's circle who form'd the only persons he ever car'd to talk to. Children he dislik'd on account of their freakishness, and their disinclination to cast their playing into coherent narrative and dramatick channels. Further adding to his unpopularity was his utter aloofness of opinion and independence of utter- ance. Born amongst orthodox Christians, he was at first a pagan and later (and still) a sclentifick sceptick. Born amonget patriotick Yankees and Sons of the Revolution and Cincinnati, he was a dyed-in-the-wool Tory who curs'd the Fourth of July from the age of three, and sang "God Save the King" when other folk sang; ✱ "America". A queer duck, altogether---and so frail that formal school was out of the question. Snatches of school appear here and there, but only snatches. After all, a cultivated family is the best school, and I am singularly complacent ahout the training this young man did not get. He did stick out four years at high school but at the cost of a breakdown which kept him from college and put him practically out of the world till three years ago. In those middle years the poor devil was such a nervous wreck that he hated to speak to any human being, or even to see or be seen by one; and every trip down town was an ordeal. Not that he ever liked people as well as cats--it is among the felidae that he has had his most valued friends....I can assure you that Nigger-Man is (or was, alas!) a glorious and purring reality! But this whole history is one of slow impoverishment and decay. Lovecraft was born to a household of four servants and three horses---and he has seen them all go....all of these, and their old home as well, for the death of his grandfather with a burdened estate forced a removal to a small flat three blocks east on the same street....the flat wherein this machine is now clicking, but which will probably go in turn during the coming spring, when finances will decree a final disintegration landing me in all probability in New York. Events? Nothing ever happens! That is why, perhaps, my fancy goes off to explore strange and terrible worlds. My mother was stricken in 1919, and one aunt or another has sub- sequently reigned here. Around 1920-1921 my health began of itself to effect that. mending which legions of specialists had for the past thirty years sought in vain. to bring about; and I have done more travelling since than I ever thought I should do in my lifetime. In 1920 I went for a visit to Boston, and slept under another roof than my own for the first time in nineteen years. The last time had been in 1901, when nervous nostalgia had forced a speedy return. My daily life is a sort of contemptuous lethargy, devoid alike of virtues or vices. I am not of the world, but an amused and sometimes disgusted spectator to it. I detest the human race and its pretences and swinishnesses---to me life is a fine art, and although I believe the universe is an automatic, meaningless chaos devoid of ultimate values or dis- tinctions of right and wrong, I consider it most artistic to take into account the emotional heritage of our civilisation and follow the patterns which xxxxxxx xxxxxxxx produce the least pain to delicate sensibilities. Thus, although holding the pompous and theocratic philosophy of the Puritans in the most abysmal contempt I believe in an honour and fastidiousness of conduct which makes me act like a Puritan and earn the name of Puritan from all who are not of that dull breed of cattle themselves. I am myself---alone---as the Bard makes crook-back'd Richard gay. All schools of thought I hold in equal contempt.

Ah, yes---that is my history---the history of intellectual and aesthetic experience. It is damned odd that I, a nearly six-foot chalk-white Nordic type--- the type of the master-conqueror and man of action---should be as much of a brooding analyst and dabbler in impressions as any ox-eyed, sawed-off Mediterranean brunet. My hair and eyes are dark, though---I suppose there is something of the Cymric elder Briton in me....at times I have liked to think that I am part Roman, as if some provincial governor or general had left his blood in the Blessed Isle, to be later mixed with that of the Saxon and the Norman as they in their turn came, And yet it is the Nordic I most admire---I am sure I would rather be a general than a poet...safe preference, since I shall never be either. Futility and ineffective- ness are my keynote. I shall never amount to anything, because I don't care enough about life and the world to try. Heigho! I am a sceptic and an analyst by nature, and early settled into my present attitude of cynical materialism. I was instructed in the legends of Santa Claus and the bible at the age of about two, and gave to both a passive acceptance not especially distinguished either for its critical keenness or its enthusiastic comprehension. Within the next few years I added to my supernatural lore the fairy tales of Grimm and the Arabian Nights; and by the time I was five had small choice amongst these speculations so far as truth was concerned, though for attractiveness I favoured the Arabian Nights. At one time I formed a juvenile collection of Oriental pottery and objects d'art, announcing my- self as a devout Mohammedan and assuming the pseudonym of "Abdul Alhazred"---which you will recognise as the author of that mythical "Necronomicon" which I drag into various of my tales. When I was six my philosophical evolution received its most aesthetically significant impulse---the dawn of Graeco-Roman thought. Always avid for faery lore, I had chanced on Hawthorne's "Wonder Book" and "Tanglewood Tales", and was enraptured by the Hellenic myths even in their Teutonised form. Then a tiny book in the private library of my elder aunt---the story of the Odyssey in “Harper's Half-Hour Series"--- caught my attention. From the opening chapter I was electrified, and by the time I reached the end I was xxxxxxx for evermore a Graeco-Roman. My Bagdad name and affiliations disappeared at once, for the magic of silks and colours faded before that of fragrant templed groves, faun-peopled meadows in the twilight, and the blue, beckoning Mediterranean that billowed mys- teriously out from Hellas into the reaches of haunting wonder where dwelt Lotophagi and Laestrygonians, where Aeolus kept his winds and Circe her swine, and where in Thrinecian pastures roamed the oxen of radiant Helios. Aa soon as possible I pro- cured an illustrated edition of Bulfinch's "Age of Fable", and gave all my time to the reading of the text, in which the true spirit of Hellenism is delightfully pre served, and to the contemplation of the pictures---splendid designs and half-tones of the standard classical statues and paintings of classical subjects. Before long I was fairly familiar with the principal Grecian myths, and had become a constant visitor at the classical art museums of Providence and Boston. I commenced a col- lection of small plaster casts of the Greek sculptural masterpieces, and learned the Greek alphabet and rudiments of the Latin tongue. I adopted the pseudonym of "Lucius Valerius Messala"---Roman and not Greek, since Rome had a charm all its own for me. My grandfather had travelled observingly through Italy, and delighted me with long first-hand accounts of its beauties and memorials of ancient gran- deur, This aesthetic trend had its result in a philosophical way, and prompted my. last flickering of religious belief, When about seven or eight I was a genuine pagan, so intoxicated with the beauty of Greece that I acquired a half-sincere belief in the old gods and nature-spirits. I have in literal truth built altars to Pan, Apollo, Diana, and Athena, and have watched for dryads and satyrs in the woods and fields at dusk. Once I firmly thought I beheld some of these sylvan creatures dancing under autumnal oaks; a kind of "religious experience” as true in its way as the subjective ecstacies of any Christian..whose xxxxxxxxxxx unimaginative emotionalism and my unemotional imaginativeness are of equal valuelessness from an intellectual point of view. If such a Christian tell me he has <u>felt</u> the reality of his Jesus or Jahveh, I can reply that I have <u>seen</u> the hooféd Pan and the sis- ters of the Hesperian xxxxxxxxxx Phaëthusa.

But in my ninth year, as I was reading the Grecian myths in their standard poetical translations and, thus acquiring unconsciously my taste for Queen-Anne English, the real foundations of my scepticism were laid. Impelled by the crude but fascinating pictures of scientific instruments in the back of Webster's Unabridged, I began to take an interest in natural philosophy and chemistry; and soon had a promising laboratory in my cellar, and a new stock of simple scientific text-books in my budding library. The books will never leave me, but the labor- atory, after being transferred to this house, I am giving to my "Alma Mater", Hope Street High School, as final domestic dispersal becomes imminent. Ere long I was more of a scientific student than pagan dreamer. In 1897 my leading literary work is a "poem" entitled "The Poem of Ulysses: or, The New Odyssey." In 1899 it was a compendious treatise on chemistry in several pencil-scribbled volumes. But myth- ology was by no means neglected. In this period I read much in Egyptian, Hindoo, and Teutonic mythology, and tried experiments in pretending to believe each one, to see which might contain the greatest amount of truth. I had, it will be noted, immediately adopted the method and manner of science! Naturally, having an open and unemotional mind, I was soon a complete sceptic and materialist. My scientific studies had enlarged to include geographical, biological, and astronomical rudi- ments, and I had acquired the habit of relentless analysis in all matters. My pompous "book" called "Poemata Minora", written when I was eleven, was dedicated "To the Gods, Heroes, and Ideals of the Ancients", and harped in disillusioned, world-weary tones on the sorrow of the pagan robbed of his antique pantheon. One of the stanzas from my "Ode to Selene or Diana" runs as follows:

Take heed, Diana, of my humble plea;
	Convey me where my happiness shall last---
 Draw me against the tide of time's rough sea,
 	And let my spirit rest amidst the past.

Hitherto my philosophy had been distinctly juvenile and empirical. It was a revolt from obvious falsities and ugliness, but involved no particular cosmic or ethical theory. In ethical xxxxxxxx questions I had no analyⓍtical interest because I did not realise that they were questions. I accepted Victorianism, with con- sciousness of many prevailing hypocrisies and aside from Sabbatarianism and supernatural matters, without dispute; never having heard of inquiries which reached "beyond good and evil". Though at times interested in reforms, notably prohibition, I was inclined to be bored by ethical casuistry; since I believed conduct to be a matter of taste and breeding, with virtue, delicacy, and truthful- ness as symbols as gentility. Of my word and honour I was inordinately proud, and would permit no reflections to be cast upon them. I thought ethics too obvious and commonplace to be scientifically discussed, and considered philosophy solely in its relation to truth and beauty. I was, and still am, pagan to the core. Regarding man's place in Nature, and the structure of the universe, I was as yet unawakened, This awakening was to come in the winter of 1902-3, when astronomy asserted its supremacy amongst my studies.

The most poignant sensations of my existence are those of 1896, when I dis- covered the Hellenic world, and of 1902, when I discovered the myriad suns and worlds of infinite space. Sometimes I think the latter event the greater, for the grandeur of that growing conception of the universe still excites a thrill hardly to be duplicated. 1 made of astronomy my principal scientific study, obtaining larger and larger telescopes, collecting astronomical books to the number of 61, and writing copiously on the subject in the form of special and monthly articles in the local daily press. As I mentioned in the preceding letter, my Intention was to become a professor of astronomy. By my thirteenth birthday I was thoroughly impressed with man's impermanence and insignificance, and by my seventeenth, about which time I did some particularly detailed writing on the subject, I had formed in all essential particulars my present pessimistic cosmic views. The futility of all existence began to impress and oppress me; and my references to human progress, formerly hopeful, began to decline in enthusiasm. Always partial to antiquity, I allowed myself to originate a sort of one-man cult of retrospective suspiration. Realistic analysis, favoured by history and by diffusive scientific leanings which now embraced Darwin, Haeckel, Huxley, and various other pioneers, was checked by my aversion for realistic literature. In fiction I was devoted to the phantasy of Poe and his congeners; in poetry and essays to the elegant formalism and conven- tionality of the eighteenth century. I was not at all wedded to what illusions I retained. My attitude has always been cosmic, and I looked on man. as if from another planet, He was merely an interesting species presented for study and class- ification. I had strong prejudices and partialities in many fields, but could not help seeing the race in its cosmic futility as well as in its terrestrial import- ance. By the time I was of age, I had scant faith in the world's betterment, and felt a decreasing interest in its cherished pomps and prides. By the age of 25 I was well on the road to my present cynicism---a cynicism marked by a contemptuous indifference toward mankind in the aggregate, but tempered with an ironic pity for his eternal tragedy of aspirations beyond the possibility of fulfilment.

As I now approach thirty-four I have no particular wishes, save to perceive facts and to receive refined and agreeable aesthetic impressions. My objectivity, always marked, is now paramount and unopposed; so that there is nothing I am not willing to believe. I no longer really desire anything but oblivion, and am thus ready to discard any gilded illusion or accept any unpalatable fact with perfect uquanimity. I can at last concede willingly that the wishes, hopes, and values of humanity are matters of total indifference to the bland, blind cosmic mechanism. Happiness I recognise as an ethereal phantom whose simulacrum comes fully to none and even partly to but few, and whose position as the goal of all human striving is a grotesque mixture of farce and tragedy. That is the essence of H. P. Love- craft. A very queer old gentleman, as all dashing and arrogant moderns will agree!

Pray don't hurry to read those other verses I sent, None are as good as "Nemesis", and could scarcely hope to rise above the filler class at best. Here are a few more of their little brothers....also to be read only at leisure. In my last epistle I said you might throw them away if of no use, but upon mature reflection I'll modify that, Since I've bothered to make fresh copies, I guess I'll hang on to the latter; wherefore I will ask you to return the discarded jingles both of this shipment and the last---in an envelope herewith provided. I'm no poet---as I copy these I see that I am generally harping on one idea, wholly subservient to the Poe influence, and not infrequently repeating xx myself to all intents and purposes---as if somebody's praise of one piece prompted me to dupli- cate the feat. Heigho, 's' a grea' life!

As to this Reading Lamp business---my word! I'm half inclined to believe you've started something! Shortly after your former letter came, I mentioned your recommendation to a friend in New York---the Mrs. Sonia H. Greens whose “Horror at Martin's Beach" you re-named "The Invisible Monster" after I had very carefully removed Mrs. G'a original title "The Nameless Monster"!---and she, knowing of my indolent habit of never getting around to anything, took it upon herself to visit the office and carry a lot of my stuff (both manuscripts and discursive letters) for the editor or editors to look over. She found the enterprise in the hands of a courteous, obliging, and literary palaeoparthenoid lady yclept Miss Tucker, whose amiability extended to the length of inviting Mrs. G. to a dinner to meet the actress Mme. Petrova and some Russian princess whose name would be too much for this 1906 rebuilt Remington. But to return to the main thread---this dictatress or virgin of the lamp was very favourably impressed with my junk---so much so, Mrs. G. writes, that her reaction might almost be termed enthusiasm. And as a result she told Mrs. G. that she intended to write me about some reviewing proposition.... which I shall certainly welcome if it means a more than theoretical augmentation of my fiscal balance. Thus your kind suggestion may possibly result in my gathering a few berries in a new pasture---though advance optimism is never judicious. At all events I thank you....and thank you also for the reading-lamp bracket enclosed in yours of the 28th. If I ever nail that 25-fish bevy of biblia (it's only $25.00 worth---the 50 was the combined sum of three separate prizes!) I shall begin my pickings (if so permitted) with the complete works (as far as published) of Arthur Machen. Slave as I am to his daemoniac spell, I don't own a bally line he ever wrote---for the Knopf reprints are all affairs of too recent date to coincide with my bygone days of financial solvency. Certe, nullas bananas hodie habemus.

[three lines of redacted text]

By the way, I hope you can pardon my garrulousness today. What moves me to such extremes must be the influence of the recrudescent Muse---for though I told you my verses were all incidents of a buried past, I neglected to mention the one corner of the grave I am forced to keep open, Long years ago I formed the habit of writing annual birthday verses to a very old gentleman of my acquaintance, a poet named Jonathan E, Hoag. He, as a co-worker in the domain of doggerel, relished my fraternal tributes very much; so that I came to feel that I could not stop without offending him. Then Parnassian disillusion came---and I put the Babylonish rebeck behind me for ever.....for ever, I say, save for this one annual misdemeanour, which I could not forego lest I hurt a gentle spirit now turning ninety-three, Feby. 10 is the day, so I have just been smitin' the bloomin' lyre in ancient fashion,..with the following disastrous result, which you, by the way, will be the first to behold:

TO MR. HOAG, UPON HIS 95RD BIRTHDAY

Warm eastern winds, with Grecian perfumes fragrant,
	Play soft about thee tho' the plain be cold,
And music trembles from each airy vagrant
	That hails thee: "Ninety-three, but never old!"

Breezes from green Cithaeron call thee brother,
	Bearing the glow of many an ancient sun;
 Arcadian airs to thee and one another 
 	Whisper the lore that makes ye all as one.

From Naxian shores a purple breath diurnal
	Brings dreams of vineyards basking sweet at noon, 
 Whilst Latmos sends a gift of youth supernal,
 	Filch'd from the dower of an enamour'd moon,

And ev'ry gentle wanderer aërial 
	Is vocal with the chant of elder choirs; 
 With songs of love divine and immaterial,
 	Bright with the fervour of forgotten fires.

The Delian string for thee again is sounded,
	And Faunus wakes once more the oaten reed; 
 Old haunting tunes, of faery spells compounded, 
 	Distil thee flow'rs from a nymphaéan mead.

Crystal and roseal, azure, gold, and argent,
	Flow'rs of a ripen'd wizardry of sight;
 Flow'rs that adorn the visionary margent 
 	Of some celestial stream or lake of light.

These dost thou ever, dreamer Apollonian,
	Weave in gay wreaths to deck our drear abode;
 As on thy brow the nobler crown Aonien 
 	Sits to reward thee for each joy bestow'd.

Year upon year comes laden to thy portal,
	Swelling thy store with riches rare and pure;
 Riches of mem'ry and of grace immortal,
 	Hoarded for thee in antique vaults obscure.

So now as three and ninety years exalt thee 
	To heights that winds etherial touch and charm, 
 No pow'r of grosser earth may chain or halt thee, 
 	Or any fate thy singing spirit harm.

Kin of the aeons, rapt with visions olden,
	Blending with the sight of loveliness sublime,

But gawd, how I ramble! Believe me, Sir, I am cover'd with confufion and confum'd with contrition!
