Dear Rhi'-Mel:—

About pronunciation—here's something I overlooked last time. How do you pronounce the name of your town? I had taken *A-sō'-tin* for granted, but the other day someone looking at an envelope on my desk pronounced it *Ass'-o-tin*. Neither side could show any real authority, so I pass the question along to one qualified to answer it. Many placenames are very hard to pronounce. I don't know yet the really proper way (as recognised by natives) to pronounce *Los Angeles*. In New Orleans the educated classes say *New Aw'l'ynnz*, while the ignorant say *New Ore-lēānz'*. A similar class difference exists in Cincinnati—where the educated say *Cin-si-nah'-ti* while the ignorant say *Cin-si-nătty*. In St. Louis there seems to be a tendency of natives to sound the final *s*, while educated non-residents hesitate to do this. In *Chattanooga* the *ch* should be given the sound it has in *chat* or *chew* or *cheese*; not t he french *sh* sound. The word is Indian. Certain state names present odd paradoxes. *Iowa* is called *I'-o-wah* by the educated and *I'-o-way* by the uncultivated—and yet there is reason to believe that the latter may actually represent the real name of the Indian tribe from which the name was derived. In the pioneering age crude Yankees always rendered an *-a* termination as either *-y* (Ameriky) or *-ā* (Floriday) ; hence when they encountered an Indian name never before put into English letters, they naturally followed this plan. Probably the Iowa Indians had a name that sounded like *I-o-way*. The pioneers spelled this *Iowā* because they thought this form conveyed the sound. But it didn't convey the sound to educated people, hence the common educated pronunciation *I-o-wah*. This theory has been *disputed*, but it has much in its favour—notably the analogy to the name *O'-jib-way* .... thus spelled and pronounced. *Arkansas* should be *Ar'-kan-sah* (or -saw)—the name being a French transliteration of the Indian sounds, hence subject to French rules of pronunciation. (cf. Dumas, Degas, etc.) Curious about *Koenig*—evidently my academic informant (who said *Kĕr'nig*) was really right from a linguistic standpoint—the trouble being a gradual though partial Anglicisation on the part of H. C. K. I fancy he represents the second or third generation of American birth—he had to study German in high school, and doesn't read it readily. That linguistic atlas will certainly bring out some curious facts. I don't think it will cover any but *English* dialects, hence will have to omit the interesting variants of French in Canada or of Spanish in the Southwest. In Canada it will ahve plenty of material, though, for local English accents vary greatly. Newfoundland has a curious brogue—probably of Scottish origin. In the maritime provinces a certain vocal quality derived from current British speech is manifest. In Montreal the speech approximates that of northern N. Y. State—and I believe that the Western prairie provinces largely resemble the American Western states above which they lie. Regarding the New York patois—I don't think any slangy usage or playful interchange of sounds can be held responsible. That isn't the way dialects grow. The reasons are generally far subtler and deeper. This case is a particularly baffling one, but some day a plausible explanation may be devised by etymologists. "Youse" is evidently a variant of the "yeez" common among the ignorant in the British Isles—especially Ireland and the north of England. I think this especial variant did develop in the N. Y. slums. The basis of this and its parent form is evidently a reluctance of the ignorant to think of a *plural* without an *s*. When the forms *ye* and *you* supplanted *thee* and *thou* in the *singular*, simple people thought they'd have to tack on an *s* to get a *plural*! Later on, an opposite *corruption of the corruption* set in, whereby *yez* or *youse* came to be used as a *singular* pronoun! Your mention of "Chinook" reminds me of the large number of North western Indian words which have entered the *colloquial* speech of Washington—or at least, of the Seattle region. One often finds them in the amateur jounrals of the *United Amateur Press Assn. of America*, whose chief local centre is Seattle. "Skaskum", "tillicum", and "potlatch" are examples which most readily occur to me. This, however, does not affect the standard literary language so far as I know.

Yrs. most cordially,  
Ech-Pi-El.
