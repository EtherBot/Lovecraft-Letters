Hellish Sabbat-Night  
January 25, 1935

Hail, O Ludvig Prinn!

.... If Prinn's immortal work is in Latin, you ought to give the title in that languageâ€”hence my change in two places (in yr ms.) to DE VERMIS MYSTERIIS (Concerning / of the worm / the mysteries). Also since knowledge of elementary Latin is so universal, I've modified the statement concerning your limitations in that tongue. Still more, I've supplies just a tantalising fragment of that hellish invocation: "Tibi, Magnum Innominandum, signa stellarum nigrarum et bufoniformis Sadoquae sigillum ..." (To thee / great Not-to-be-Named / the signs / of the stars /black / and / of the toad-shaped / Tsathoggua / the seal ... ) .........

Luve-Keraph
