Dear Helen:—

......................... I offer no apologies for my devotion to these scenic survivals of other days, since to my mind "progressiveness" is a thing absolutely meaningless in itself. The whole notion of continuous "progress" towards a presumably "superior" goal is a mere post-Renaissance innovation, & is already losing some of its charm for thoughtful analysts. What most benefits mankind is *not constant change, but satisfactory adjustment*. When a race has achieved a certain settled harmony with itself, its way of life, & its geographical setting, it is not only very foolish but actually criminal to wish it any change. Change is the enemy of everything really worth cherishing. It is the remover of landmarks, the destroyer of all which is homelike & comforting, & the constant symbol & reminder of decay & death. it is change which makes one old before his time by snatching away everything he has known, & substituting a new environment to which he can never become adjusted. Happy is the man who can grow up & flourish in the midst of an unchanging countryside. For him half the terror & tragedy of aging does not exist, for he never loses the visible world of his youth. Never does he face the hideous alienage of one whose eyes wander vainly for the sight of some familiar thing. And so I deplore all needless change, & feel no shame in my love for all that is old & stable. The only sort of opposition to change which is culpable, is that which insists on the retention of such old forms & institutions as have become really harmful through their conflict with a new (& inevitable) environment utterly different from that which evolved them. Even in this case the culpability does not imply that the environmental change is necessarily desirable. Such changes are generally mere matters of sheer, uncontrollable drift, which we have to face whether we will or no. But when they *do* occur it is of course needful to bring practical institutions into harmony with them, in order to restore the same degree of approximate equilibrium which we had before they occurred. Thus the inevitable growth of the machine age has rendered our system of *laissez-faire* economics obsolete & unworkable, so that we can never have peace till we replace it with some fresh system fitted to the new conditions & restoring to the average man the power to earn a living. Yet a preaching of this need of replacement does not argue the desirability of change in itself. Rather is it an attempt to recapture a harmony which is lost. And side by side with this recognition of *necessary* change. Indeed, the more landmarks we *have* to lose, the more tenaciously do we need to cling to those which we *don't* have to lose. Thus the same thinker who urges a change of property-allocation or industrial regulation to fit an inevitably changed economic trend, may simultaneously—& with perfect logic—give zealous battle to any proposed change in folkways, art forms, or philosophic assumptions, which he may feel to be unjustified, or essentially unrelated to any genuine environmental mutation. We must save *all that we can*, lest we find ourselves adrift in an alien world with no memories or guideposts or points of reference to give us the priceless illusions of direction, interest, & significance amidst the cosmic chaos. Hence the natural function & social value of the antiquarian & cherisher of elder things. To them we owe much of our sense of comfortable continuity & appropriate placement. It is surely a tragedy that so many things *needlessly* change. The east as well as the west suffers from the desecration of the tourist—the wide, straight cement roads, the garages & filling stations, & all that. But at least there are a few mercifully unspoiled backwaters left, where one may see the visible forms known to his forefathers, & absorb a trace of that sense of place & permanence without which all life above the primitive level would form a meaningless & maddening vortex. I can certainly sympathise regarding the burning of your home & the loss of all your familiar possessions. I was altogether disorganised when I lost my original home in 1904, but I have at least managed to hang on to the books, furniture, pictures, & other objects most vital to me. When *those* have to go, it will be about time for the old man to follow them into nothingness! Still—with a fair amount of cash, anyone can even now find havens remote from the visible evidence of change & decay. Some of the old coast towns & mountain villages of New England linger to this day as they were when the republic was young. And even in the larger places there are oases where a good deal of the cherished & the accustomed can yet be found. The same is true of the South. He who dwells in Charleston—say in Legare or Tradd or Laenhall or Gibbes St.—has little immediate reason to think that the world has changed since 1800 or 1820. In such a place even the Civil War & the machine age & the depression have produced only minor dents. Yes—& I think parts of Quebec would afford the same sense of continuity top anyone able to derive it through French cultural symbols. This is especially true of the Isle d'Orleans.

This autumn I have had some very refreshing glimpses of traditional scenes, notwithstanding the general inclemency of the present month. On warm days I have taken many pedestrian jaunts to rustic realms north of Providence—while on Oct. 19-21 I paid a brief visit to my host of last August in the Boston region—Edward H. Cole—& was taken on some magnificent scenic rides in his well-heated Chevrolet. Oct. 20 we visited north central Massachusetts & enjoyed some superlatively fine vistas of autumn foliage, distant hills, steepled villages, rocky glens & waterfalls, & everything that goes with inland New England at its best. We lunched in the ancient & unspoiled village of West Townsend—of which the enclosed card gives only the very faintest suggestion—in a rambling tavern built in 1774. Here, also, we found a quaint "general store" precisely like those of a century ago. On the 21st Cole & his wife took me back to Providence, picked up my aunt, & continued onward into Rhode Island's famous Narragansett country—the region where E. Hoffmann Price & I did so much exploration just before your passage through Providence. This is the most distinctive region in New England—where the social order departed furthest from the pattern of Puritan yeomanry. Here, as in the South, there were large plantations with many slaves before the Revolution—with an agricultural & patriarchal life in full swing. Dairying & horse-breeding predominated—Narragansett cheeses & Narragansett pacers being known over half the world in the 1750's & 1760's. The Church of England predominated (with Quakerism as its main rival), & houses of worship were situated in lonely woodland regions, as in Virginia, whither congregated the planters each Sunday in their coaches or on horseback. Life was predominantly rural, despite such attractive villages as Updike's Landing (now Wickford) on the coast, & Little Rest (now Kingston) somewhat inland. The great plantation-houses had gambrel roofs, & were usually vastly enlarged specimens of the New England farmhouse model. Only one or two of these can be found today—so tragically complete was the passing of the old life after the revolution. The scenery is of especial loveliness—in places closer to Old England than anywhere else in America. Well—on this occasion we explored ancient Wickford with its crumbling wharves, great elms, & centuried white houses, & continued southeast to the sprawling old snuffmill on the Narrow River where the great painter Gilbert Stuart was born in 1755. The mill—built in 1750—has lately been restored in every detail,  & the obliging caretaker set the great wheel going for our benefit. The adjacent river & meadow & woods & stone-walled road held an autumnal beauty altogether too poignant for adequate expression except by a poet—& twilight brought a violet magic paralleled only by the glimmering vistas of dream. I could scarcely bear to think of leaving—though a return to the city had to be made in the end. Cole, however, was so captivated by the region (which he had never before seen) that he attempted some pioneering which got us momentarily lost! Since that day I have had one pedestrian outing, but the season is getting late for such things now. The leaves are beginning to fall, & desolation & chill will soon be upon the land. Then the long hibernation, relieved only by hopes of returning spring!

............... Speaking of music—I enclose an account of a highly interesting lecture which my aunt & heard the other night. You doubtless know all about the lecturer & his work. I enjoyed it immensely—even though to me the historical side may have appealed more strongly than the purely musical. The selections were rendered with what I would call supreme skill—& just to make the cast an all-star one, the music-turning was accomplished by Prof. S. Foster Damon, eminent poet & authority on Thomas Holley Chivers. With Mr. Howard's thesis I found myself in as much agreement as is possible for a layman with no real right to an opinion. He deplored the laboured, conscious efforts to create a purely autochtonous American music, when as a matter of fact no really authentic, spontaneous body of melody could exist apart from the continuous stream of European heritage. How naive to fancy that our European stock could express itself (as some moderns believe it can) in the musical traditions of the Indian or of the plantation negroes! And more—it is equally absurd to fancy that conscious, cold-blooded striving can ever create a tonal type of aesthetic expression. That is not the way art grows. What is authentic must be unconscious & spontaneous—something produced not to fulfil certain formal technical requirements or to prove certain abstract theories, but simply because the producer naturally feels like doing things that way. This is of course just as true in other arts as in music—& ought to be remembered by the architectural modernists who so painfully strive *to express our current machine civilisation* by means of abhorrently ugly concoctions of restless steel & glass construction. These fellows *think* they are representing the present as Ictinus represented classic Greece & as Wren represented Queen Anne's England—but if they would stop to think, they would realise that Ictinus & Wren achieved their effects not by grimly resolving to *express their periods,* but merely by creating such forms as appealed to them, without any thought or place. Moreover—Ictinus & Wren did not exclude all elements from the past. Instead, they built upon & modified the mainstreams of art which they inherited. Hence to my mind all these anti-traditional radicals are up a blind alley. Their products are not art, because they come from theory instead of from feeling. And they do not represent this age, because they do not embody those attributes of the European mainstream which this age has inherited. But I digress.

Your argument regarding the modesty or egotism of genius must have been interesting indeed—& I presume you were right, in the long run, in maintaining that great aesthetic creators tend to have an overdeveloped ego, while persons eminent for pure intellect preserve a realistic sense of proportion & are more interested in their work than in themselves. At first—so absurd is the egotistic attitude—one feels tempted to say that *no* truly great person can be self-centered; but after examining concrete cases one has to change one's opinion. The secret is, I suppose, that art is almost wholly non-intellectual—& in many cases anti-intellectual. The supreme artist usually has no chance to cultivate a sense of proportion or scale of philosophic values; & is so wrapped up in the process of emotional expression that he cannot take a clear objective glance at himself, the whole human race, & the universe. Retaining much of the narcissism of infancy, he continues to think of his own moods & caprices as the central facts of existence & the most important things in the world. It is unfortunate that such a defect has to accompany the greatest creative skill—but, if the skill be truly great, we can afford to excuse its concomitant drawbacks. The most exasperating spectacle is that of the inferior pretender who, without any of the skill or substance of greatness, possesses all the coxcomb vanity & coddled neurotic egotism commonly associated with artistic eminence. These pathetic clowns fancy they are great because they have the weakness which great persons sometimes have—as if all club-footed people were as great as Byron because Byron had a club-foot! Actually, egotism is simply a result of the absence of thought. It is not absolutely universal among the foremost artists—Virgil, Milton, Wren, Copley, Wordsworth, Galsworthy, & scores of other front-rank creators have been thoroughly normal & modest—because the moment one starts to *think,* he cannot help dropping it at once .... & there is nothing about great art which utterly forbids its practitioners to use the frontal lobes of their brains. Scientific thinkers, of course, are modest; since the primary requirement of a sincere observer & interpreter is a clear perspective & sense of coördination. The really analytical brain perceives from the start that the mysteries of the external world are a million times more dramatic & interesting than the limited round of its own local phenomena, or the totally irrelevant question of how it is regarded by the meaningless crowd of other brains around it.
