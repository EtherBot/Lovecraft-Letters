Ancient Nantucket  
Septr. 2, 1934.

Dear Helen:—

.........................  
I am surely glad to hear what a delightful & inspiring time you have had—& am pleased that the return to every-day life could be tempered by an intermediate seacoast session at Inverness. Your mountain experience sounds arduous & thrilling indeed—especially to one who is apt to be disconcertingly dizzy in high places. And it was fortunate, too, that you could encounter some sound philosphical discussion calculated to dispel the macabre reflections of recent months.

The Unicorn's horn sounds like a vastly hazardous proposition, & I doubt if I would have followed the party except on a dare. I am a wretched climber & balancer, & had to practice by discouragingly difficult stages before I could hold my own among the young monkeys of my day. Unlike young Melmoth I have no *urge* to jump off high places—but on the contrary am darned afraid I'll *fall* off! It's just as well, I'm sure, that you adopted a milder programme after that Unicorn feat. Your violin-playing must have placed the camp vastly in your debt! Most doubtless realised the handicaps under which you laboured. Mr. Curtis sounds like a most gifted & interesting artist, & you were surely fortunate in receiving one of his sketches. How I envy anyone who can record & preserve his impressions in effective pictorial form!

Yes—Belknap will really have to depend on time & his own maturing attitude to pull him out of his maternal fixation & kindred neuroses. Others can do no more than help to create a general atmosphere favourable to the development. I think the emergence is slowly taking place. The past who years have seen a growing reaching-out after external contacts & experiences, & a gradual groping towards greater independence, which will gain momentum as further time passes. I think that Mrs. Long formerly aggravated the trouble through over-solicitude—not demands for attention, but a protective care which prompted over-attentiveness as a return. Now, however, I believe that she realises the need of fostering independence, & favours more freedom on Belknap's part. But of course such late changes must be gradual. She will still now & then be oversolicitous, & he will now & then be both over-dependent & over-anxious. Time & increased doses of common-sense are what will turn the trick. So far as Belknap is concerned, active *objective* interests are what he needs.

................ Regarding the advantages & disadvantages of a general attitude of detachment—of course one loses considerable pleasure & interest if one feels no kinship whatever to anything human. So extreme an attitude would of course be a mistake. The right idea is to follow a sort of middle course whereby one may take a rational interest in the buzzings of the human hive without being completely dominated by its mechanism. To recognise empirical forms & relationships as *proximately* valid—valid, that is, on the surface & for the moment—& to take from them whatever harmonious pleasure can be taken; but to realise, behind it all, that visible objects & patterns are purely transient & capricious things ...... things whose meaning is not basic or cosmic, & from which too much cannot be expected. only this *underlying* realisation—a realisation which does not need to be obtruded into all of one's every-day thoughts & moods—can (in the absence of childish soporifics like religion) save one from the extremes of disappointment & painful disillusion. It does not have to be a ponderous or heavily-borne thing—indeed, in many it is purely instinctive, temperamental, & quasi-unconscious. It simply means the extension of one's rational sense of proportion from small objects & issues to great—even universal—objects & issues. In other words, it means a resolution & capability to use one's emotions instead of to be used by them. Thus I do not think it could greatly hamper one's appreciation of the simpler beauties of life, whose appeal is to the most direct forms of sensory perception. Rather would it teach us to accept those simpler beauties as intrinsic ends in themselves—roses to be gathered while we may—uncomplicated by mythical linkages to non-existent eternal things. I have fairly detached & impersonal perspective myself, but I don't see that it has dulled in any way my appreciation of the drama of history, of the loveliness of the sunset, of the grace of noble architecture, or of the charm of shapely black kittens like little Sam Perkins! ....................

New England certainly has a peculiar charm not found elsewhere in America—the charm of a distinctive landscape bearing the evidences of a continuous, well-adjusted life of many centuries' standing; a life expressing itself in architectural forms perfectly suited to the topography & to the prevailing institutions. This is what Europe has in abundance—but which never became transferred to the New World except in New England .... though the New Netherland Dutch & Pennsylvania German regions .... & perhaps the unspoiled parts of French Quebec ..... vaguely approximate it. In Florida & California & the Southwest the Spaniards created isolated buildings of beauty, but produced no instinctive outgrowth from the peculiar local landscapes involved. In the Anglo-Saxon South, too, there were beautiful plantation-houses & beautiful towns; but no general sprinkling of cottages & villages exactly suited to the countryside. On the contrary, the small farms of the South tend to look rather awkward & squalid. Ditto for French Louisiana. And of course the pioneer regions had not the basic conditions needed to develop such a spontaneous folk growth. Thus New England stands alone as a bit of the Old World transferred bodily to the New—a virtual *extension* of Old England itself. That is really what it is, as we may readily appreciate when we consider the conditions of the great 17th century colonisation. Other parts of the country consisted of vast land areas with a thin & slowly arriving population. New England, on the contrary, was a region no larger than Old England—into which, between 1630 & 1645, poured shipload after shipload of settlers ..... colonists reckoned in tens of thousands. Clearly, the pioneering stage could not last long under such conditions. Among the settlers were representatives of every art, craft, & trade in England—not merely planters & farmers, as elsewhere. Towns grew up thickly from the very first, & in them craftsman & merchants followed the same pursuits that they had followed in England. Farmers were so numerous that their holdings dotted the whole coastal strip on which they were settled—one farm touching another, till in a single generation the coast was so crowded that some of the young folk had to strike out more deeply into the wilderness—into central Massachusetts, Maine, & the Connecticut Valley. Here was indeed another England on a small scale—& this as early as 1650 or so. Towns with thousands of inhabitants & bristling with mediaeval gables (see enclosed card of John Ward house, Salem), & a countryside as thickly settled as the old world, with European cottage architecture adapted to the local terrain & building materials. And this form of life kept on & on without a break .... unbroken even now in many quiet backwaters ..... piling up traditions, refining hereditary usages & forms, & building gradually on never-changed foundations .... just as in Europe. By the time of the Revolution the country was *old*. The periwigged, knee-breeched men of 1775 could behold all around them houses 100 or 120 or 140 years old—some in long-abandoned styles of architecture, & already falling to decay. And still the pageant rolls on .... the cycle of the years, with slow growth on original foundations. Rolling fields—stone walls—giant elms—winding roads—low-roofed cottages—clustering barns & byres—gnarled hillside apple-orchards—white village steeples rising from clouds of verdure & seen in the distance across fertile valleys—blue streams winding amidst grassy plains—rocks in fantastic outcrops & groupings—deep woods from which a magic twilight never departs—towns with steep hill streets & fanlighted doorways & gleaming-columned court-houses—waterfronts with rambling wharves & clustering warehouse gables—brick Georgian mansions glowing redly in the sunset ...... all the myriad phases of one homogenous growth; one coherent whole. That is ancient New England! Of course, this applies only to the *old* New England—the parts where the real population still live in their traditional way. There is none of it left along the great urban trunk lines ..... hotdog stands, factories, bungalows, skyscrapers, garages, & all that .... but these are fungous growths peculiar to no one region. An eruption symptomatic of the disease of a mechanised psuedo-civilisation. In Nantucket, thank heaven, the real thing yet survives! I don't think any amount of familiarity could really satiate one with the subtle, lingering charm of New England. Of course the winters are beastly & barbarous—but I shall feel lost indeed if they ever force me to leave this ancient realm for one more physically habitable.
