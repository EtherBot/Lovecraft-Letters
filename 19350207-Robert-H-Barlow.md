Now as to the aesthetic value of certain things which certain persons cannot "enjoy"—as typified by my attitude toward Dreiser—I rather think that the apparent dilemma comes from a too subjective attitude—aggravated perhaps by a confusion of mere *names* as distinguished from underlying realities. After all, what *is* "enjoyment"? How is the *sense of power-recognition* inherent in certain forms of aesthetic appreciation to be distinguished from the general quality of "enjoyment" also manifest—under other circumstances—in the sensation of sheer superficial pleasures? In all these cases there is a sense of exaltation—of ego-expansion—which must in the strictest sense be regarded as *enjoyment*. The *kind* of recognition of truth inherent in a genuine work of art is infinitely different from that involved in the reading of a reliable newspaper. The paper presents only *specific facts*; which—although they may be correct—are not selected with any view of *illustrating universal truths of human nature* or exercising the deeper emotions of the reader. They are conveyed through the medium of direct and unproportioned statement—which basic and irrelevant matter unseparated. What we get is no more and no less than we would get from first-hand observation. Drama and emotion may impress us, but only to the degree they would in real life,. On the other hand, art *is* selective. A great realistic novel, while not representing events as other than what they would be in real life, *chooses what aspects of these commonplace events to empathize*, and therefore *throws into high relief such elements of universal experience and emotion as may reside in those events*. That is the great difference between life at first hand (seen visually or through prosaic reporting) and life as seen through the medium of authentic realistic art. Art imposes a diaphragm or pattern or colour-filter which enables us to pick out the really moving and significant and universal elements in any given glimpse of life—*but if it is good art it will not distort or falsify the given section to be examined*. You can easily see the difference between *picking certain elements out* of an undistorted section of life, and actually *distorting a section of life*. The latter is what *romantic* fiction habitually does—and that is why I do not consider romance to be art in the truest sense.

But to get back to the question of *pleasure*. Really, we've been arguing about nothing—for as I've said, the recognition of universal truth through the medium of art—a different thing from the mere perception of isolated facts through the window or in the daily press—involves definite emotions of expansion which cannot be distinguished from *enjoyment* in its highest sense. That is what aesthetic appreciation is .... and if anyone is insensitive o these emotions, the fault is in him rather than in the kind of art involved .... assuming, of course, that the art is indeed genuine as tested by a representative number of properly sensitive and qualified persons. Now as a matter of fact almost all of us are very unequally developed—emotionally even more than intellectually. Very few persons are sensitive to all forms of art in equal degree—so that one man's meat is another man's poison. If we refused to call anything art unless it pleased *everybody*, we could not be able to recognise any such thing as art. Therefore we must, as a matter of common sense, recognise as art anything which brings the sense (enjoyment) of universal truth or harmony *to any representative number of generally high-grade and properly educated people*. For instance—of three different things (say Baudelaire, fine bindings, and Wordsworth) you and a dozen others may like one or two and dislike (or be indifferent toward) the others. Belknap and a dozen others may like one or two—perhaps the one or ones you dislike—and hate the one you like best. And Jim Morton and a dozen others may prefer above everything else one which both you and Belknap hate. Now in a set-up like this it can't be that the whole groups of judges are dead wrong whilst others are dead right. There's too much variation. Obviously, there must be *something* of real value in *all* the kinds of things under consideration. But is this an admission that all aesthetic values are subjective, and that anything at all may be either good or worthless according to the emotions of the observer? *Not a bit of it!* To continue our test, let us take a *fourth* kind of thing .... something different from any of the other three, and intensely pleasing to millions of people .... say a "poem" by Edgar A. Guest. Set the same judges on it—you and Belknap and Morton, and others like each of you—and see what the verdict will be. Disagreement again? *Nothing of the sort!* Here we have something *entirely different*. You and Sonny and Jim and all the rest *vote together as one man against the material considered*. Despite your differences regarding certain things, here's something about which you are all unanimous. Somehow or other—whether through your intellect or emotions—you all, as high-grade persons properly trained, recognise that a certain class of things lacks some element about whose presence or absence you differ when other classes of things are under consideration. You may think that Baudelaire and Merrymount bindings have the element (i. e., give you pleasure) and that Wordsworth doesn't—but you're sure Guest doesn't. Belknap may think Baudelaire and Wordsworth have it but that bindings don't—but he's sure Guest doesn't. Morton may think bindings and Wordsworth have it but that Baudelaire doesn't—but he's sure Guest doesn't. Now what conclusion must a disinterested onlooker necessarily draw from all of this? Naturally, he must realise that Baudelaire, fine bindings, and Wordsworth all represent something on the one hand—despite individual differences—which on the other hand Eddie Guest *doesn't*. High-grade, educated men *can* like Baudelaire, fine bindings, and Wordsworth .... *whether or not all such men do* (and many *do* like all three)—but no such man can possibly like Eddie Guest. Here is the basis for a *genuine* and absolute distinction*. We may say that Baudelaire, fine bindings, and Wordsworth *all represent genuine art*, whether or not any given *individual* may respond to any or all of them, whereas Guest does *not*. There is a quality common to certain things—even though they affect different people differently—which certain other things lack. *Art is a quality which is capable of giving certain high-grade and cultivated people a sense of universal truth or rhythm constituting pleasure in its purest sense*—WHETHER OR NOT ALL SPECIFIC MANIFESTATIONS OF IT PLEASE EVERYBODY OF HIGH-GRADE AND CULTIVATION. Of course—if everybody were *theoretically perfect* in mental and emotional balance and sensitiveness, we would *all* be responsive to *every* form of art just as soon as education opened up our channels of perception and recognition. But the human race simply isn't built that way. We are for the most part imperfect chance products of varied evolutionary conditions, so that any one of us must be content with only *part* of the aesthetic responsiveness which an ideally perfect human being would possess. Some of course are lucky enough to possess a much wider range than others ... but nobody is 100% responsive to all the aesthetic stimuli which exist.

But how about the man who says he *recognises* a kind of art which does not actually please him or otherwise stir his emotions—myself say, in relation to Dreiser? Is such a guy a hypocrite or a babbler of nonsense? I don't think so. When he says an art-phase doesn't please *him*, he *recognises that it may and does please others*. As I have intimated, the human *intellect* is much more *uniform* (in *kind*, though perhaps not in *degree*) than the human *emotions*; so that any person of ordinary acuteness can learn to distinguish the qualities which separate real art (i. e., material which cannot give real aesthetic pleasure to *anybody*). Of course this process of distinguishing may be purely intellectual—the distinguished may not be able to respond emotionally to a great deal of the material which his cool perception and reason classify as truly artistic (i. e., capable of evoking a true emotional response from *somebody*). *But that doesn't make the unfelt material any the less artistic*. In such a case the critic is simply conceding that he has an emotional blind spot—as we all have in one direction or another. *His* emotions can't get a kick out of the material—but his *brain* is able to recognise in the stuff something which can and does *give other people* a kick. What is other than sound about such a classification? The guy knows what he's doing. Put a piece of trash before him and he'll reject it as inartistic. It may not affect his *emotions* any differently from the really artistic thing that left him cold, but his intellect recognises the difference—he knows that this thing couldn't possibly evoke a real emotional response from any cultivated person. Take the case in point. Dreiser leaves me *rather* cold .... although my recognition of his power *does* give me a certain sense of universal drift which comes close to the borders of appreciative pleasure. But I know that really sensitive and cultivated men like Mencken and Vrest Orton and thousands of others *are profoundly and pleasurably moved by him*. And I have enough perceptyion and power of comparison to discover in him a certain definite and recognisable elements of universal truth and harmony *which correspond to certain elements in other things which do move my own pleasurable emotions,* but which are entirely absent from still other classes of things—those classes which do not please or move *any* high-grade people. I know—as a rational observer and analyst—that Dreiser has something which (in another form) Poe and Keats and Wagner and Harry Clarke and Hobbema also have, but which Eddie Guest and Nictzin Dyalhis and Seabury Quinn haven't. What if he doesn't move me as Poe does? Poe doesn't move Orton as Dreiser does. Who expects every individual to be responsive to every aesthetic stimulus? I recognise Dreiser as art but don't feel him acutely. Orton recognises Poe as art but doesn't feel him acutely . ........................
