Dear Mr. Petaja:—

Regarding the settings for tales—I try to be as realistic as possible. The crumbling old towens with winding alleys & houses 100 to 250 or more years old are realities on the New england coast. Providence has any number of houses dating back to 1750 & thereabouts—the one I live in was built 130 years ago. Boston's oldest house dates from 1676; Haverhill has one build in 1640, & so on. My fabulous "Kingsport" is a sort of idealised version of Marblehead, Mass.—while my "Arkham" is more or less derived from Salem—though Salem has no college, "Innsmouth" is a considerably twisted version of Newburyport, Mass. I hope you can see some of these old towns some time—they are my principal hobby. ..............

Best Wishes  
    Yrs most sincerely
