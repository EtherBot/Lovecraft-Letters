Dear Rhi'-Mhel:—

.........

My visit to Long—as you've doubtless learned from a postcard of a fortnight ago to Eph-Li—was a highly enjoyable event. The whole business acquired something of the atmosphere of a convention through the presence of Barlow and the arrival of *both* the Wandrei boys—Howard unexpectedly coming on from St. paul as Donald landed from San Francisco. The Brothers have taken a very attractive four-room flat in greenwich Village—at 155 West 10th St., above a rather well-known "bohemian" restaurant called Julius's. The building is about a century old, but made over into apartments with all conveniences. Well—Barlow reached the metropolis Christmas morning, and Belknap took him in charge and found him an hotel six blocks north of the Long place. Young Bobby is rather hard to suit, since he demands especially good neighborhoods and will not consider anything without a private bath.

The whole business acquired something of the atmosphere of a convention through the presence of Barlow and the arrival of *both* the Wandrei boys—Howard unexpectedly coming on from St. paul as Donald landed from San Francisco. The Brothers have taken a very attractive four-room flat in greenwich Village—at 155 West 10th St., above a rather well-known "bohemian" restaurant called Julius's. The building is about a century old, but made over into apartments with all conveniences. Well—Barlow reached the metropolis Christmas morning, and Belknap took him in charge and found him an hotel six blocks north of the Long place. Young Bobby is rather hard to suit, since he demands especially good neighborhoods and will not consider anything without a private bath. I am not so exacting—so the Longs always get me a room in one of the flats over theirs. These rooms have running water—but unlike Barlow, I am willing to dodge around to the bathroom for my matutinal tub! This was Bob's first visit to New York since infancy, so Belknap was kept busy showing him the various museums, galleries, art shops, and bookstalls. What fascinated him most was the great Metropolitan Museum with its priceless paintings, Egyptian and classical collections, and everything else under the suyn. We all agree that if any sudden holocaust were to engulf Manhattan Island, and if the gods were to allow only *one* object or institution on it to be saved, the Metropolitan Museum is what we would choose for preservation. I reached Belknap's on the morning of Dec. 31, and from then on the events developed rapidly. On Jan. 2, the gang held a monster meeting at Long's with fifteen present—Morton, Loveman,Barlow, Leeds, Kirk, Kleiner, Koenig, both Wandreis, Talman, etc. etc. It was the most enjoyable event I've attended in years—even if Talman did take surreptitious snapshots of the guests with a new German camera which works in ordinary electric light .... catching me in an especially awkward pose, with my mouth looking as if I were about to whistle a tune or expectorate! Two evenings later a smaller gathering met at Loveman's Brooklyn apartment, our host showing us his magnificent collection of almost four undred Cark Ashton Smith drawings ... mostly in colour and all tremendously impressive. This is undoubtedly the finest array of Klarkash-Ton's work outside Auburn—and Loveman has only recently brought it to New York from his old home in Cleveland. I had seen it in 1922 in Cleveland, but it was wholly new to Belknap, Ar-E'ch-Bei, and the two Wandreis. On another occasion Koenig showed Barlow, Belknap and me through the Electrical Testing Laboratories, in which he holds an important executive and engineering position. This is a fascinating place, with all sorts of bizarre devices (suggesting spacerockets, bathyspheres, atomic projectors, and every kind of scientifictional standby) for gauging the safety and durability of various household electrical appliances—lamps, cords, plugs, refrigerators, flatirons, heaters, etc. etc. As a climax to this exhibition, Koenig gave us a demonstration of *artificial lightning* caused by the passage through the air—betwixt two mettalic poles—of a current of tremendously high voltage. A good deal of our time was taken up by the book stores, art shops, and art department of the public library. During the course of the visit Ar-E'ch-Beo bought a copper-plate and dry point stylus, and began experimenting with the engraver's art. In the bookstalls we encountered several attractive bargains. Barlow—lucky little rascal—stumbled on a fine old copy of Goerge W. H. Reynold's *Wagner the Wehr-Wolf* for only *fifteen cents!* My own chief bargain was a good modern edition of Lewis's *Monk* for a dollar. I now have all three of the most famous Gothic novels—Mrs. Radcliffe's *Udolpho* (1785), *The Monk* (1795), and Maturin's *Melmoth* (1820) ... all in modern editions. Other sessions of the gang were at the Wandrei brothers' flat. We didn't get a chance to look up old de Castro although we half started out for his place at least twice. There was so little time—and so darned many things to do! The breakup began Jan. 7th, when Barlow set off for Washington at eleven-thirty a. m. He cannot stand night travelling as I can, hence had to forfeit a day in N. Y. I stayed on till midnight when the Wandreis saw me to the Providence coach. ....

Yrs. most sincerely—  
E'ch-Pi-El
