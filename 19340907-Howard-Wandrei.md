Dear H. E.:—

...... I have not the cleverness to study herd & editorial caprices & deliberately suit them in a cold-blooded way despite the repulsiveness of the process. Even if I conquered my nausea & attempted it, the result would be lifeless & unacceptable. The very editors who demand the sacrifice of artistic integrity would be the first to object to the stiltedness of the result. Literature & pulp writing can't mix—& only an exceptional person (like Auguste-Guillaume, Comte d'Erlette, for example) can successfully prosecute both at the same time. I, alas, am far from exceptional! I need the cash desperately enough, but don't see how I could possibly get it *that* way. If I could ever be sure of $15.00 per week—or even $10.00 per week—through some honest employment outside the writing field, I'd never think again of the commercial side of authorship. The really lucky guy is the one whose *natural* mode of expression happens—through pure chance—to coincide with some form of writing in popular demand. Robert E. Howard is the best example of this I can think of at the moment—his stories sell, but they have a zest & naturalness which at once distinguish them from the listless, synthetic pap of ...... all the rest of the hacks. ..........

Yrs most cordially & sincerely—  
HPL
