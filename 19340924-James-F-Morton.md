Paramount Pattern of Pater-prying Persistence:—

...............

.. I was knock'd flat with piled-up work—and on the 12th we bowled over with a hellish siege of indigestion. ..

.. Pain all gone now, though I'm feeling none too rugged, and am still pretty damn careful what kind of stuff I dump into the old belly. Couldn't do any reading or writing to speak of during the worst of the trouble, so that I'm simply knocked down and out now. Shall have to send a form letter to my fifty-two-odd correspondents—or something!

But the saddest news is yet to come. Alas—how can I impart it unmov'd? Little Sam Perkins, the tiny ball of black fur whom you saw in August, is no more! he was ill then—but fully recover'd and was quite his novel dynamick little self. As of late Sept. 7 he spent the day with Grandpa—tearing about the place, shuffling the papers on the old gentleman's desk, and finally stretching out like a little ebony stick in the semicircular chair, sound asleep. On the morning of the 10th, however, he was found peacefully lifeless in the garden—and from no apparent cause. Now he sleeps beneath the shrubbery amidst he play'd in life. Blessed little Piece of the Night! he liv'd but from June to September, and will never know what the winter's hellish cold is like. The Kappa Alpha Tau is in deep mourning and President Randall often mews in Elegiack numbers—

The ancient garden seems tonight  
A deeper gloom to bear,  
As if some silent shadow's blight  
Were hov'ring in the air.

With hidden griefs the grasses sway,  
Unable quite to word them—  
Remembering from yesterday  
The little paws that stirr'd them.

During his latter days Master Perkins was fully inducted into the K.A.T.—appearing frequently on the clubhouse roof. Eheu—the hold place is not the same without him!

And so it goes.

Yrs. for bigger and better forefathers—  
Theobaldus Perkins, Gent.
