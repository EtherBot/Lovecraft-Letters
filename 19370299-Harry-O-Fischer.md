Unknown Kadath—  
(Late February, 1937)

Valiant & (I fervently trust) Undrowned Mouser:—

.......... Regarding the element of *fear*—I don't think I share your immunity. I am a middle-grounder, with *heights* as my weak point. Lacking any natural sense of balance (some of those curious equilibrating devices in the inner ear must be weak or absent in me), I become dizzy in lofty & difficult places, & could easily fall to a pulpy doom (in more than the figurative, literary sense) if I tried to duplicate some of the stunts which others perform as a matter of course. I used to war against this weakness, & have at times temporarily conquered it enough to let me walk on high, narrow wall-tops & over dizzying trestles—but in later years I have lost ground. Just about a decade ago I began refusing to take dares—beginning with the time a friend challenged me to walk along the foot-wide and not-quite level parapet of upper Riverside Drive in New York, with a 500-foot perpendicular drop to ragged rocks & railway tracks on one side. In other fields, however, I'm an especial Caspar Milquetoast—being willing to take a chance where there really *is* a chance. I'm not especially set on living for ever, although I'd dislike meeting a messy or disintegrative end. I don't bear pain well, & dodge it whenever possible. However, I endeavour not to do my yelling out loud. In infancy I was afraid of the dark, which I peopled with all sorts of things; but my grandfather cured me of that by daring me to walk through certain dark parts of the house when I was 3 or 4 years old. After that, dark places held a certain fascination for me. But it is in *dreams* that I have known the real clutch of stark, hideous, maddening, paralysing *fear*. My infant nightmares were classics, & in them there is not an abyss of agonising cosmic horror that I have not explored. I don't have such dreams now—but the memory of them will never leave me. It is undoubtedly from them that the darkest & most gruesome side of my fictional imagination is derived. At the ages of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, & 8 I have been whirled through formless abysses of infinite night and adumbrated horrors as black & as seethingly sinister as any of our friend Fafhrd's "splatter-stencil" triumphs. That's why I appreciate such triumphs so keenly. *I have seen these things!* Many a time I have awaked in shrieks of panic, & have fought desperately to keep from sinking back into sleep & its unutterable horrors. At age of six my dreams became peopled with a race of lean, faceless, rubbery, winged things to which I applied the home-made name of *night-gaunts*. Night after night they would appear in exactly the same form—& the terror they brought was beyond any verbal description. Long decades later I embodied them in one of my *Fungi from Yuggoth* psuedo-sonnets, which you may have read. Well—after I was 8 all these things abated, perhaps because of the scientific habit of mind which I was acquiring (or trying to acquire). I ceased to believe in religion or any other form of the supernatural, & the new logic gradually reached my subconscious imagination. Still, occasional nightmares brought recurrent touches of the ancient fear—& as late as 1919 I had some that I could use in fiction without much change. *The Statement of Randolph Carter* is a literal dream transcript. Now, in the sere & yellow leaf (I shall be 47 in August), I seem to be rather deserted by stark horror. I have nightmares only 2 or 3 times a year, & of these none even approaches those of my youth in soul-shattering, phobic, monstrousness. It is fully a decade & more since I have a known *fear* in its most stupefying & hideous form. And yet, so strong is the impress of the past, I shall never cease to be fascinated by *fear* as a subject for aesthetic treatment. Along with the element of cosmic mystery & outsideness, it will always interest me more than anything else. It is, in a way, amusing that one of my chief interests should be an emotion whose poignant extremes I have never known in waking life!

Of the celebrated "phobias" of the modern psychologists (or of things like them) I have only *one*; & that, amusingly enough, is one I have never seen cited or named. Probably it *has* a name & record, but my very superficial knowledge of psychology (a subject which fails to fascinate me greatly, despite its grotesque fictional possibilities) does not include any glimpse of it. I know about *claustrophobia* & *agoraphobia*, but I have neither. I have, however, a *cross betwixt the two*—in the form of a distinct fear of *very large enclosed spaces*. The dark carriage-room of a stable—the shadowy interior of a deserted gas-house—an empty assembly-room or theatre-auditorium—a large cave—you can probably get the idea. Not that such things throw me into visible & uncontrollable jittery spasms, but that they give me a profound & crawling sense of the sinister—even at my age. I'm not sure of the source of this fear, but I believe it must link up somehow with the black abysses of my infant nightmares. Anyhow, I keep it in mind to deflate my ego when I tend to feel superior about the illogical aversions & timidities of others. Grandpa must not forget his Achillean heel!

.......... The name "Abdul Alhazred" is one which some adult (I can't recall who) devised for me when I Was 5 years old & eager to be an Arab after reading Arabian Nights. Years later I thought it would be fun to use it as the name of forbidden-book author. The name *Necronomicon* (νεκρός, corpse;νόμος, law; εικών, image = An Image \[or Picture\] of the Law of the Dead) ocurred to me in the course of a dream, although the etymology is perfectly sound. In assigning an *Arabic* author to a *Greek-named* book I was whimsically reversing the condition whereby the monumental astronomical work of the *Greek* Ptolemy (Μεγάλη Σύνταξις Τής Αστρονομίας) is commonly known by the *Arabic* name *Almagest* (or more truly, Tabrir al Magesthi), which was evolved from a corruption of the original title when the Arabs made their translation (μέγιστη is the superlative of μεγάλη, & the Arabs probably found it in common use to distinguish the work from another of Ptolemy's). It was not until later that I took the trouble to hunt up a genuine Arabic title (Al Azif—a word which I found in Henley's learned notes to *Vathek*. I use the term correctly, though at second-hand) for old Abdul's *original* versions of the Byzantinely translated νεκρόνόμικον. .....

I can well comprehend the vague impression of aloneness or differentiation which you have always had in some degree. Such, I imagine, is always the concomitant of a very active imagination & highly individualised personality. The bulk of the human race lives very little in the imaginative realm; hence can seldom grasp the goals, motives, & aspirations of anyone with whom subtle perspectives, symbolic associations, & obscure mental correlations form important emotional factors. Such a one must inhabit a quasi-solipsistic world of his own even more completely than the average individual, & he is always fortunate when he encounters others of a cast sufficiently similar to appreciate the existence, general principles, & typical laws of his private universe. This general comprehension of separate worlds & their workings is usually as sound a basis of congeniality as that rarer & perhaps wholly non-existent phenomenon of an *identity* of private universes. At least, what makes me feel cordial & at ease toward anyone is not so much an identity of tastes & beliefs & perspectives, as an assurance that my own tastes & beliefs & perspectives are not regarded as insane, incomprehensible, or non-existent! .......
