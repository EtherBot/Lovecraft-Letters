Dear Mrs. Wooley:—

As to writing—there is never any need of hurrying about it. Practice and experiment are as useful as complete story-writing—all these processes aid in the development which one seeks. .......... Congratulations on the sales—but I don't believe you need regret not having framed your first cheque. Such a thing never occurred to me when my first literary remuneration came—in August, 1906, nearly 30 years ago. The fact is, I have never been interested in the commercial side of writing—& am even hostile to it. It is the ruination of sincere artistic expression, & has cut off the literary development of more than one writer of splendid endowments. ....... I absolutely refuse to make compromises—editors can either take what I want to write, exactly as I write it, or go to the devil. Naturally, I can't make original writing pay—but if I can't keep afloat through other ways I'll cheerfully starve. So, in general, the matter of literacy remuneration is not one about which I am apt to wax enthusiastic.

Yes, indeed—voodoo, black magic, the history of the witch-cult, & everything of that sort is surely of the keenest interest to me. I continually borrow the standard classics on this subject from the ample library of the generous H. C. Koenig. ........ African witch-doctors (& their West Indian Descendants), following tribal customs of incalculable antiquity & working on the minds of ignorant devotees trained from infancy to believe in the wildest forms of magic, do indeed create effects of the greatest marvellousness. They are masterly unconscious psychologists & hypnotists; & when we understand how profoundly the human mind can be influenced by suggestion, we need not wonder at the baffling & startling results they are able to secure. Of course, tales of their deeds become heightened through repetition & through sensational newspaper exploitation. Strange as are the things they *do* accomplish, they never accomplish even half of what they are popularly credited with! By the way—if you ever find any books hard to get in K. C., both Koenig & I would be glad to lend you anything we have. So many promising & deeply interested weird fans live in places where bizarre books are unobtainable—places like Milltown, Mont., Asotin, Wash., Auburn, Cal., West Shokan, N. Y., &c.—that we feel we ought to give them the benefit of whatever columes of the sort we may chance to possess. Hence a rather active programme of borrowing is carried out among "the gang". And it is not only the small-towners who need to borrow—for even the largest city libraries are sometimes devoid of the most important weird items. Thus Koenig & I lend to each other as much as to any third & fourth & further parties .... right now I have his copy of the famous old *Malleus Maleficarum*.

I remain  
Yrs most sincerely,
