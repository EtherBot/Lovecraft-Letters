Dear Malik:—

... I myself couldn’t handle that kind of work at present—for collaboration is a tremendous handicap to me. I can do good work only when wholly independent—and working with my own ideas. I’m too near a nervous smashup to attempt anything with as much strain and forced labour as collaboration .... that is, in the fictional field. If I ever expect to attempt anything of my own again, I must cut off all external influences fictionally. ..

Old 'Dolph is a queer cuss. His original name is Gustav Adolf Danziger, and he was born somewhere along the Baltic (I don’t know just where) in a German-speaking region belonging to Russia. ... Some years ago he went to Mexico and tried to get data on Bierce’s disappearance, and in 1928 he wrote a life of Bierce which consists largely of subtle self-advertising. Long revised it and wrote the preface—after I had turned down the job. He undoubtedly capitalises his acquaintance with Bierce. He changed his name during the war, when everything with a Germanic suggestion was unpopular .... de Castro being the name of a remote Spanish ancestor. He has dabbled in Republican politics for 40 years, and once drew as a reward the really important post of American consul at Madrid—under McKinley, I think. I’ve revised several tales for de Castro—you may recall *The Last Test* and *The Electric Executioner*. ....

As for further news of Randolph Carter—I’m afraid that'll be darned hard to supply, unless you have special advices from Yaddith or Thok or any of the places where a bird in his odd position would be likely to hang out! If I ever use him again, I fear it'll have to be in my especial way—with the mystical and dream elements emphasised, and with no technical mathematical skeleton to stick to. The idea you propose is infinitely clever, but it really ought to be developed by someone capable of appreciating the mathematical background, That is the only way it can be really spontaneous. To me, mathematics is a field too remote and abstract to form a basis for fictional imagination. Using it under external instructions, I find it a dead weight obstructing the free flow of fancy instead of a nucleus for the growth of fancy. It is a tool too large and complicated for me to work naturally with. Weird fiction, to have significance, must form an authentic symbol or picture of some genuine mood—and I can’t interpret any mood mathematically. But there certainly is a great field for anyone who can translate these bold mathematical concepts into fiction without retaining the air of the classroom in the result. Why can’t that pioneer be yourself?

I don’t believe I could tackle any collaboration at present—for I’m saving all possible energy for experiments in original expression which will be miles away from anything externally determined. Collaboration is the most exhausting of all work for me, since it entails the almost intolerable hardship of conforming my imagination to some predetermined plan which chokes off all creative energy. The process is really wasteful—for with the same outlay of energy I could achieve infinitely better results if working alone and imaginatively unchecked. What I want to say is so infinitely different from anything that anybody else wants to say! That is why I absolutely could not collaborate with good old Whitehead on Cassius. With me, collaboration tends to spoil both what I have to say and what the other fellow has to say! Clearly, it is something which can be truly successful only with writers much more objective than I. But, as I said before, that mathematical idea ought certainly to be used—and by someone to whom mathematics is a vivid emotional reality. Better tackle it independently unless you know of someone who is both a fluent fictioneer and a mathematician. If you don’t want to try it as a Randolph Carter yarn you don’t have to. It will be easy enough to get Randolph back to earth if he’s needed—a bit of enlarging on the final phase of the Silver Key sequel would turn the trick. But I have my doubts about the real value of a repeated character. Such a being tends to grow deplorably hackneyed unless one has a clearly envisaged line of development to put him through—as in a novel—or unless one keeps him as a very subordinate element in the different episodes. The more I look over my old stuff the more disgusted I get with it—and with my efforts as a writer. Only once in a while do I approach what I am really trying to do, I need to make a clean break with whatever I have been doing, and start afresh after a rest—harking back to actual dreams and impressions as in 1917. My

first attempts will probably have certain resemblances to my earlier stuff as distinguished from my later, although many typical crudities of the early period can be avoided. Adjectival extravagance will be restrained, but there will be an effort to present clouded pictorial effects rather than to indulge in prosaic pseudo-scientific explanation. Roughly Speaking, I shall try to do with greater skill what I did crudely and half-accidentally around 1920 and 1921. My work of that period was—except for the Dunsanian pieces—especially my own, because I had no idea of publication, Once more I must forget that beings like Satrap Pharnabazus exist. Just as long as I think of anyone but myself, I shall never write. Any gains of mine since 1921 have been wholly technical. I can write better, but I have not so much to write. Therefore I am going to take my added technical knowledge and go back to 1921, emotionally speaking. It may be that I cannot regain the lost ground—that I am definitely written out—but the only way to find out is to try, I shall not exhibit to anyone the more unsuccessful attempts—of which I expect there will be a great number. But first I must arrange for leisure in which to make my attempts. I am accordingly being quite ruthless in pushing my way free of other obligations. It will, though, probably be quite a while before I can embark on any serious experimentation.
