Ancient Nantucket  
—Septr. I, 1934

Dear arechbei:—  

.......... I am well disposed toward everyone in general, and naturally prefer to contemplate the excellencies of others rather than ferret out and gloat over their mistakes. The only things which really disgust me are cruelty, smallness, and selfish egotism—and even these, I realise, often coexist with highly admirable qualities and substantial gifts. I neither idealise nor hate—but simply observe and accept. I am an enemy only to those who actively injure me or war against things which I believe must be upheld. And even then my enmity goes no further than a wish to frustrate aggression and punish specifically in a way commensurate with the injury inflicted. ..
