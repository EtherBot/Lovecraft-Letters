Catacombs of Koth  
—Septr. 25, 1934

Dear Ar-Ech-Bei:—

.................... Aside from the mechanical routine of professional revision—wherein one cannot do otherwise than perform all jobs on a purely business basis without investigating their outside bearings—I confine my heavy assistance and ghost-writing to *two kinds of cases,* neither of which involves the constitutional parasite. First—I help all genuine *beginners* who need a start. I tell them at the outset that I shan't keep it up long, but that I'm willing to help them get an idea of some of the methods needed. If they have real stuff in them, they soon outgrow the need for such help. If they haven't, I let them drop as hopeless cases as soon as I recognise their hopelessness. In either event, no one of them has my assistance for more than a year or so. Second—I help certain *old or handicapped people* who are pathetically in need of some cheering influence—these, even when I recognise them as incapable of improvement. In my opinion, the good accomplished by giving these poor souls a little more to live for, vastly overbalances any harm which could be wrought through their popular overestimation. ............
