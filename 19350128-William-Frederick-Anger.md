Dear Anger:—

..... As for Wright's acceptances & rejections—I've long ago given up trying to find any central thread of reason in them. They are clearly governed by caprice, pure & simple. One of his favourite tricks is to reject a tale & then recall it for acceptance. As to the work of C. L. Moore—I don't agree with your low estimate. These tales have a peculiar quality of cosmetic weirdness, hard to define but easy to recognise, which marks them out as really unique. *Black God's Shadow* isn't up to the standard—but you can get the full effect of the distinctive quality in *Shambleau & Black Thirst*. In these tales there is an indefinable atmosphere of vague *outsideness & cosmic dread* which marks weird work of the best sort. How notably they contrast with the average pulp product—whose bizarre subject-matter is wholly neutralised by the brisk, almost *cheerful* manner of narrative! Whether the Moore tales will keep their pristine quality or deteriorate as their author picks up the methods, formulae, & style of cheap magazine fiction, still remains to be seen. A. Merritt fell for the pulp formula, hence never realised his best potentialities. Miss Moore may do the same. But at present she certainly belongs in the upper tier of *W. T.* contributors along with Smith, Howard, &c. ....

I've never been able to understand the psychology of drink—just why people consider it desirable to spend most of their time in the clutch of a poison which sends them back several million years along the evolutionary scale! I'm 44, & have never touched alcoholic liquor. Somehow or other, my imagination seems to function in its humble way without external aid! ....

Blessings, & the Peace—
