Dear Malik:—

This new thing—a second version—fails to satisfy me, and I don't know whether to finish it as it is or destroy once more and start afresh. Pressure of other duties has for the moment made any original writing impossible. The incomplete effusion is about ¾ done. It will probably mark my last attempt in the vein of recent years.

Bismillah, etc—  
Abdul Alhazred
