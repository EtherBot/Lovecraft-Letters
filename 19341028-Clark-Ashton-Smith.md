Bottomless Chasm of Zhun—  
Hour of the Green Shining Below.  
Oct. 28, 1934

Dear Klarkash-Ton:—

.......

Well—I've read the Sinclair opus with keen interest and have likewise gone over the wealth of cuttings you so thoughtfully sent. .. He has his weak spots and extravagances, yet his general orientation is in the direction towards which all western civilisation is inevitably moving. On the other hand, the Republicans who hate and fear him represent thoroughly exploded order of things, based on long-vanished modes of industry, which can never hope to keep more than a fraction of the population fed and clothed, and which leads directly to a desperate revolution. The *Chronicle* (speaking frankly, of course, for capitalism) presents many interesting arguments, but in many ways shows that its concern is for *economic institutions* rather than *people*. Some of the parallels it draws are open to question, and Prof. Kreps reveals his limitations when he naively says that

  "Plans to be successful must not only be based upon facts, but should be capable of execution without disrupting established institutions."

Now this is merely a plea for a static worship of dead words, mouldy documents, and vanished dreams. Certainly we do not wish to disrupt any really vital *social and cultural institutions;* but none of these is involved in the sort of disruption demanded by the reasonable economic change. Established *economic* institutions must constantly be disrupted as modes of industry and distribution change, and it is both asinine and suicidal to fancy that a set made to fit a bygone agricultural age can be preserved in a mechanised age like that of the present and future. The whole relation of the individual to industry has been altered—Now this is merely a plea for a static worship of dead words, mouldy documents, and vanished dreams. Certainly we do not wish to disrupt any really vital *social and cultural institutions;* but none of these is involved in the sort of disruption demanded by the reasonable economic change. Established *economic* institutions must constantly be disrupted as modes of industry and distribution change, and it is both asinine and suicidal to fancy that a set made to fit a bygone agricultural age can be preserved in a mechanised age like that of the present and future. The whole relation of the individual to industry has been altered—and the whole relation of resources to the community is equally revolutionised. All this is excellently treated in Stuart Chase's recent *Economy of Abundance*. The empty catchwords of "initiative", "opportunity", "individualism", "enterprise", "stamina", "American spirit", "self-sufficiency", etc., etc. currently slobbered by Republican politicians have no more bearing on anything in today's machine world than have the meaningless taboos of Eoanthropi or the hieratic precepts of Egyptian priests. Every condition on which they were founded is absent from the interrelated welter around us. We *must* disrupt existing institutions *so far as they pertain to the control and distribution of resources*. But only a disingenuous pleader for plutocracy would try to confuse *this* kind of "disruption"—or economic rearrangement—with the total *cultural* disruption attendant upon violent upheavals like the Russian revolution.

The more I reflect on the present economic crisis in relation to all the forces involved, the more I am forced to repudiate the whole fund of economic and political folklore on which the reactionaries base their plea. It is dead material—words—attitudes—illusions—prejudices—without any bearing on existing things and existing needs. I never fully appreciated all of this before, because I never really *thought* about economics prior to 1930, when world events began to compel thought in this field. Formerly I was an arch-conservative; all for royalists, aristocratic order. My conversion has by no means been hasty; but has come step by step, as facts have driven me. For of course you realise that no reputable thinker today (you can't call people limited to business thinking, with the profit motive held paramount, such) endorses unsupervised capitalism. Virtually *all* the *disinterested* world of philosophers and historians recognises the absolute need and inevitability of change. John Dewey—Bertrand Russell—H. G. Wells—Stuart Chase—the late Thorstein Veblen—indeed, the list is too long to complete. Laissez-faire capitalism is as dead as feudalism or trial by the ordeal of iron or water. It no longer offers more than *part* of the people *any chance* of earning food and shelter—and any attempt to restore its full provisions in the United States would be the signal for a really justified uprising of the starving and desperate. Change of some sort is not a theory but an arrived inescapable condition. The question is merely one of *what* change, and *how rapid* a change, we shall have.

I don't doubt but that Sinclair wants to move too fast—yet I really think that is better, just now, than trying to sit on the safety-valve. Some of his extreme plans will doubtless become modified as he sees the obstacles which stand in their way—this being indeed already apparent, as you yourself point out. Others may not be as bas as they sound. There is, for example, no need of preserving private banking if the people's funds are generally transferred to state banks before any lapse occurs—and the same is true of those private utilities (light, power, transportation, etc.) which some have hitherto used as investments. These investments were anti-social to start with, for no one has any right to expect private profit from widespread services whose only object should be to perform certain functions for the community. It is only according to a false and obsolete system of values that the destruction of large-scale private industry is to be deplored. It must come someday anyhow—and the only question is how fast it shall come. I would prefer a fairly gradual evolution, but it may well be that the New Deal as a whole is too slow for immediate needs. There are millions to be fed, and some way must be found to deliver to them the unused wealth hoarded uselessly by the graspers of private profit. If it can't be managed legally, it will be managed by violence. The world is going to see a period of continuous upheaval until some fresh conditions of fairly stable equilibrium can be worked out—some fresh balance between human needs and available forces, whereby the average individual may again have a chance to obtain food and shelter in exchange for his services. Naturally we can't go through such a period of readjustment without much discomfort on the part of many—but all that has to be reckoned with and borne. It won't do any good for the few beneficiaries of the dying order to try to hang on to their yachts and extra cars by throwing monkey-wrenches into the wheels of inevitable change. They might just as well shut up, face facts, and help to make the inevitable change less uncomfortable through the use of their technical skill. But of course they won't! Instead, they'll join Jim Beck and Bainbridge Colby and Al Smith and Reed and all the rest of the archaic yappers in sabotaging any intelligent attempt at necessary experimentation. That's human nature! If the people turn from the moderate New Deal to the extremes of Sinclair, Huey Long, Bilbo, and their congeners, it will be largely because the reactionaries have hampered moderate measures in every possible way. And so it goes. Schools of thought as moderate as that of the *New Republic* consider Sinclair a lesser evil in spite of his obvious drawbacks, and I doubt if I could conscientiously be on the other side considering what the only real other side is. So many of the current objections are based purely on *words* and popular prejudices. Suppose, for example, Sinclair *does* advocate many measures practiced in Soviet Russia? Is that necessarily against him? As a matter of fact dozens of *individual features* of the Soviet programme are well worthy of emulation and adaptation by the nations of the western world. That would not mean a full reproduction of the Russian upheaval. It would merely mean a sensible recognition of certain intrinsically wise and useful measures, considered without prejudice and irrespective of their source. Naturally, each one would be tremendously altered in its adaptation to an highly industrialised Anglo-Saxon milieu. But to exclude and condemn some sensible idea merely because the Soviets happened to think of it first, is positively childish. There's plenty in Russia that we don't want—but what has this to *do* with what we do perhaps want? Sinclair is far enough from the alien New York communists who yearn for another Moscow! Probably the least desirable feature of the Sinclair programme is that involving an influx of indigents—but even this may perhaps be exaggerated. If the plan in any ways succeeds, its duplication in other states would probably serve to keep such a migration within bounds. Of course I can see how alarming the whole thing looks to anyone on the spot—but the fact is that all change must begin somewhere some time .... and the need of legal change, if we are to avert a revolution, is pretty manifest today! We were pretty close to a revolution just before Hoover was kicked out.

Well—that's the way I look at things. Of course I'm the rankest of laymen, and wholly unable to estimate the effects of given causes; but just now even a layman can appreciate the lack of any future in laissez-faire capitalism. *That* can almost be counted out of any argument. The question is one of a suitable substitute or modification—and here we are all at sea. It seems to me that the first thing is to break up the existing deadlock and start *something* .... *anything*. Until capitalism is really shaken, it will make no concessions, but will simply wait till a revolution blows the whole civilisation up. It is our job, then, to shake it—to shake it until its upholders are willing to think and plan for some alternative order yielding them less profit. They won't start thinking and planning until they're booted in the behind—hence it is now necessary to boot 'em! Undermine their foundations, and then they'll *have* to use their practical ability for some purpose other than personal purse-stuffing!

In some ways I differ sharply with conventional philosophy to which you still profess allegiance—these differences arising partly from my strong sense of tremendously and permanently altered balance of forces and resources in the modern machine world, and partly from my lifelong and directly anti-Marxian conception of *cultural* values as distinct from *economic* values.

For example—even before I gave thought to these matters I always despised the bourgeois use of *acquisitive power* as a measure of human character. I have never believed that the securing of material resources should form the central interest of human life—but have instead maintained that *personality* is an independent flowering of the intellect and emotions wholly apart from the struggle for existence. Formerly I accepted the archaic dictum that only a few can be relieved of the engulfing waste of the material struggle in its bitterest form—a dictum which is, of course, true in an agricultural age having scanty resources. Therefore I adopted an aristocratic attitude; regretfully arguing that *life*, in any degree of fulness, is only for the fortunate few whose ancestors' prowess has given them economic security and leisure. But I did not take the bourgeois position of praising struggle for its own sake. While recognising certain worthy qualities brought out by it, I was too much impressed by its stultifying attributes to regard it as other than a necessary evil. In my opinion, only the leisured aristocrat really had a chance at *adequate* life—nor did I despise him because he was not forced to struggle. Instead, I was sorry that so few could share his good fortune. *Too much human energy was wasted in the mere scramble for food and shelter.* The condition was *tolerable only because inevitable in yesterday's world of scanty resources*. Millions of men must go to waste in order that a few might really live. Still—if those few were not upheld, no high culture would ever be built up. I never had any use for the American pioneer's worship of *work and self-reliance for their own sakes*. These things are necessary in their place, but not ends in themselves—and any attempt to make them ends in themselves is essentially uncivilised. Thus I have no fundamental meeting-ground with the rugged Yankee individualist. I represent rather the mood of the agrarian feudalism which preceded the pioneering and capitalistic phases. My ideal of life is *nothing material or quantitative,* but simply *the security and leisure necessary for the maximum flowering of the human spirit*. To my mind no other supreme ideal is sound—and if this is "un-American", then so much the worse for what the politicians call "American". Actually, I believe that my ideal has flourished naturally in many parts of America—Virginia, South Carolina, and even my own New England before the cursed revolution of 1775-83. It is by no means a supine or decadent one—for it involves points of honour, inviolateness, responsibility, and courage fully as arduous (and in many cases more so) as any brought out by the fight for worldly resources. It is that of the gentleman as distinguished from that of the tradesman—and is to my mind especially worthy of upholding because of its repudiation of that *calculativeness* and *ulterior motivation* inseparable from the acquisitive character. That everyone could not feasibly pursue it in the agricultural age of scarcity was a source of genuine regret to me.

Well—so much for the past. Now we live in an age of easy abundance which makes possible the fulfilment of all moderate human needs through a relatively slight amount of labour. What shall be the result? Shall we still make resources *prohibitively hard to get* when there is really a plethora of them? Shall we allow antique notions of allocation—"property", etc.— to interfere with the rational distribution of this abundant stock of resources among all who require them? Shall we *value hardship and anxiety and uncertainty* so fatuously as to *impose these evils artificially* on people who do not need to bear them, through the perpetuation of a set of now irrelevant and inapplicable rules of allocation? What *reasonable* objection is there to an intelligent centralised control of resources whose primary object shall be the elimination of want in every quarter—a thing possible without removing comfortable from any one now enjoying it? To call the allocation of resources something "uncontrollable" by man—and in an age when virtually *all* natural forces are harnessed and utilised—is simply infantile. It is simply that those who now have the lion's share don't want any fresh or rational allocation. It is needless to say that no sober thinker envisages a workless equalitarian paradise. Much work remains, and human capacities differ. High-grade service must still receive greater rewards than low-grade service. But amidst the present abundance of goods and minimisation of possible work, these must be *a fair and all-inclusive allocation of the chances to perform work and secure rewards*. When society *can't* give a man work, it must keep him comfortable without it; but it must give him work if it can, and must compel him to perform when it is needed. This does not involve interference with *personal* life habits (contrary to what some reactionaries say), *nor is the absence of insecurity anything to deplore*. If "stamina" and "Americanism" demand a state of constant anxiety and threatened starvation on the part of every ordinary citizen, then they're not worth having! Better far to be "decadent" than to tolerate such a brutish waste of human energy! All this feverish complaint about the "dependence" of the modern citizen is simply a savage echo of the old petty-bourgeois concept of *acquisitive power* as the only ultimate measure of human quality. I spit upon this concept today from the standpoint of a rational socialist, as I spat upon it yesterday from the standpoint of an agrarian feudalist. I regard it as something fundamentally hostile to all that is best in mankind and the human spirit.

But of course the real need of change comes not from the mere fact of abundant resources, but from the growth of conditions making it impossible for millions to have any chance of getting *any* resources under the present outworn set of artificial rules. This development is no myth. Machines had displaced 900,000 men in the U. S. *before* the crash of '29, and no conceivable regime of "prosperity" (whereby a *few* people will have abundant and flexible resources and successfully exchange them among one another) will ever make it possible to avoid the permanent presence of *millions* of unemployed, so long as old-fashioned laissez-faire capitalism is adhered to. The feeble argument that new machines create new jobs has no serious standing. The ratio is wrong. For every ten men employed in some *new* industry, one hundred or more are displaced in *all* industries. Every day sees the development of some new device which makes every sort of work performable by fewer and fewer men. Even if the *proper* supplying of the *entire* population *would* keep everybody naturally busy (which is unlikely in the view of the ease of duplication. The technocrats of 1932 brought out some profoundly significant truths!), laissez-faire capitalism offers no way for the entire population to get purchasing-power enough to demand proper supplying. The whole dying system is self-defeating. Really, it is not the Sinclairs, but its own dead weight and unworkableness, that are killing it!

Without wishing to boast, I must remark that I recognised this matter of technological unemployment long before the depression, though I then (in the depths of my thoughtlessness) advocated a wholly different solution. Being then a convinced feudalist, I believed that the great industries would eventually come out into the open and *visibly* instead of secretly control the government. I advocated *letting them do it*—believing that they would have the sense to handle the growing problem of human displacement themselves. I thought they would recognise the revolutionary peril of the unemployed millions of the future, and would *voluntarily* curtail profits enough to spread work among more men, and provide old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. I assumed that the *funded proprietor* of the future would come to feel the same basic responsibilities as those felt by the *landed proprietor* of the past—and that eventually the great accumulations of wealth would once more breed a *real gentry* with non-acquisitive interests and a true ability to use cultivated leisure to advantage. I now see how tragically I overestimated the rationality of the plutocrat. Instead of the benign aristocrat I had looked for, we had only the "let-'em-starve" profit-Shylock of the Hoover era!

And so I have readjusted my ideas. I fancy you can see that, with me, the process has not been any wild emotional jump like Sonny Belknap's plunge into Russian bolshevism. I have gone almost reluctantly—step by step, as pressed by facts too insistent to deny—and am still quite as remote from Belknap's naive Marxism as I am from the equally naive Republican orthodoxy I have left behind. I am as set as ever against any *cultural* upheaval—and believe that nothing of the kind is necessary in order to achieve a new and feasible *economic* equilibrium. The best of culture *has always been non-economic*. Hitherto it has grown out of the *secure, non-struggling* life of the aristocrat. In future it may be expected to grow out of the secure and not-so-struggling life of whatever citizens are personally able to develop it. There need be no attempt to drag culture down to the level of crude minds. That, indeed, *would* be something to fight tooth and nail! With *economic opportunities* artificially regulated, we may well let *other* interests follow a natural course. Inherent differences in people and in tastes will create different social-cultural classes as in the past—although the relation of these classes to the holding of material resources will be less fixed than in the capitalistic age now closing. All this, of course, is directly contrary to Belknap's rampant Stalinism—but I'm telling you I'm no bolshevik! I am for the preservation of all values worth preserving—and for the maintenance of complete cultural continuity with the Western-European mainstream. Don't fancy that the dethronement of certain purely economic concepts means an abrupt break in that stream. Rather does it mean a return to art impulses typically aristocratic (that is, disinterested, leisurely, non-ulterior) rather than bourgeois. There is nothing in *bourgeois* culture which need be mourned. It was cheap and contemptible from the start. I can sympathise with the anti-commercial attitude of the classical Greek as distinguished from the essentially bourgeois Phoenician.

Whether any real decade has indeed overtaken the Aryan race is another matter demanding separate consideration. It so happens that the last few generations have witnessed profound changes of thought and custom through the progress of human knowledge and mechanical technology; and some of these changes have undeniably tended toward the breakdown of traditional inhibitions. Absence of religious restraints has operated adversely on those lacking aesthetic standards and practical sense, while the multiplication of material luxuries (we must not confuse this growth of *luxury* with the possible future growth of *security*. It does not hurt a man to know that his old age is provided for, but it *may* soften him to ride on cushions where he used to walk—and so on) has certainly promoted a trace of softness and effeminacy in the race. On the other hand, I do not regard the rise of woman as a bad sign. Rather do I fancy that her traditional subordination was itself an artificial and undesirable condition based on Oriental influences. Our virile Teutonic ancestors did not think their wives unworthy to follow them into battle, or scorn to dream of winged Valkyries bearing them to Valhalla. The feminine mind does not cover the same territory as the masculine, but is probably little if any inferior in total quality. To expect it to remain perpetually in the background in a realistic state of society is futile—despite the most feverish efforts of Nazis and Fascisti. However—it will be some time before women are sufficiently freed from past influences to form an active factor in national life. By the time they do gain influence, they will have lost many of the emotional characteristics which now impair their powers of judgement. Many qualities are commonly regarded as innate—in races, classes, and sexes alike—are in reality results of habitual imperceptible conditioning.
