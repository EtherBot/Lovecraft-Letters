Dear Miss Toldridge:—

................ Curious that the *FF* no longer reaches you. If you paid a dollar at the outset, you ought to have received the magazine for 128 months according to Editor Hornig's special offer of Sept. '33. .... I'd advise you to drop him a line anent the matter—or I will. Meanwhile I enclose the issue dedicated to me, plus the Dec. issue with the reprint of my Poe chapter. These need not be returned, since I have duplicates. I also enclose a catalogue of a rather interesting exhibit at the college which my aunt & I have just been to see. The Japanese puppets are of the most grotesque aspect conceivable—much like some of little Barlow's drawings. Another interesting current exhibit—at the art museum—is of 18th century French wallpaper—much of which adorned the Georgian houses of colonial America. These was an interesting lecture on this last Sunday.

................ I've just indulged in a rather badly-needed travagance—bought 2 dark-walnut sets of drawers for filing purposes. My files have been getting almost out of control. Expect delivery today—but haven't quite decided how I'll arrange them. I may pile one atop the other & thus have a single tall cabinet. The total of 10 drawers will do much toward bringing order out of my present chaos. Got the cabinets at a fire sale—$14.44 each. Long recently acquired something similar.

All good wishes—
