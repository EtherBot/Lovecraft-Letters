Home again, and on the old River-Bank.  
July 16, 1934

Dear A. W.:—

I found yours of the 25th ult.—together with 28 other letters—awaiting me when I reached home last Tuesday. And what Alpine accumulations of packages and printed matter, and what a monolith of piled-up newspapers! I am only about a quarter straightened out yet, and don't know when I shall ever get readjusted. Had a great week in St. Augustine—seeing all the old sights and inspecting many houses which were not open as museums on my previous visits. Also saw the recumbent skeletons in the Indian graveyard unearthed last spring. Moved north on the 29th—spending 2 days in Charleston, one in Richmond, one in Fredericksburg, two in Washington, and one in Philadelphia. In Washington I inspected the interior of the Capitol and ascended the Washington Monument for the first time. In Philadelphia—besides visiting ancient Germantown and the Wissahickon—I explored the brick cottage tenanted by Poe from 1842 to 1844, and opened a few months ago as a museum and shrine. When I hit N. Y., I found the Longs about to leave for Asbury Park and Ocean Grove over the week-end, and at their cordial invitation went along with them. .. It was good to see the rolling hills, giant elms, stone walls, and white steeples of ancient New England again—though northern scenery seems almost strange after my saturation with palms, live-oaks, Spanish moss, and all that goes with them. As usual, I spend all my afternoons in the open country—though there is an added attraction at home in the form of a coal-black kitten (born last month and just beginning to be playful) at the boarding-house across the back garden. ....
