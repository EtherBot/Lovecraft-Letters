Dear R E H:—

As you know from my card, I duly reached home again and found the spider in excellent condition, This monster now adorns my museum shelf in company with the Florida snake and other exotic bits—including the rattles for which I am indebted to you. I'd certainly rather see him there—safe in a bottle—than crawling around my quarters!

My trip, it is needless to say, was enjoyable down to the bottom line. Since I probably described St. Augustine in detail in 1931, I needn't cover the ground again—except to repeat how potent an imaginative spell lies around those ancient houses and that centuried, brooding fort. Here is a place that was over fifty years old when the first Pilgrim landed in Plymouth! On this occasion I saw an added feature of great interest—an old Indian graveyard just unearthed at the site of the
primitive native village north of the town. The skeletons lie side by side, with feet toward the east, and will be permanently preserved in their original positions. The excavation work has been very careful—each skeleton and the earth around it being protected by a low wall of cement. Eventually a large museum building will be erected over the unearthed area. The aspect of the find—which was made only a few
weeks before I saw it—is very weird indeed. From the posture of the bodies it is plain that they were buried under the auspices of Franciscan priests—probably around the year 1600.

As to my ideals of government, you certainly have me wrong. You say you do not hate human development, and yet you sneer at my ideal of a government restricted to men who are properly trained for the job and who know what they are doing! Moreover, you say that if my ideal of government were in force, I would—or could—have you burned at the stake because of your tastes and interests. Now that is precisely the opposite of anything which my kind of government would ever do, want to do, or permit to be done! The *absolutely first* requisite of any mature or genuine civilisation is *complete intellectual and artistic freedom*; so that no restriction whatever would be placed upon any sort of individual thought or tastes. An opinion changed by force is an opinion not really changed at all. No real civilisation wishes to change anyone's Opinion except through rational arguments designed to make the holders of error see the error of what they have been holding. Do not judge the sort of fascism I advocate by any form now existing. Every different civilisation needs a different form adapted to its own temperament; and the Italian, Turkish, and German forms represented by Mussolini, Mustapha Kemal, and Hitler are not for us. I would be the last to endorse any of these restrictive systems as applied to Anglo-Saxons.

....... My object in all arguments is *not to make any preconceived opinion of mine seem right*, but merely *to discover and establish the truth, whatever the truth may be*. ...

.... I do not think that any part of America has achieved a degree of civilisation equalling western Europe's, and I do not even give my own region first place in comparing types of American civilisation. Instead, going by such evidence as I have received and digested, I would tend to award that distinction to Charleston and the South Carolina low country. I don't favour or oppose any region as a region. I merely recognise and respect certain qualities in life, and rejoice when I find them anywhere. Very often the same region will combine the qualities I respect with those I detest in the most paradoxical fashion. What I admire is human development away from the unicellular stage—development of all the powers latent within man, and encouragement of such conditions as give them scope. What I detest is human degradation or retardation in any form—violence, ugliness, ignorance, sensuality, brutality, cruelty, abnormality, filth, cloddishness, rapacity, egotism, encroachment, violations of physical or spiritual integrity, and everything that goes with a dull acquiescence in the animal patterns of the lower part of creation. Any civilisation or way of life which encourages what I respect and combats what I detest gains my endorsement, in whatsoever part of the world it may lie; and vice versa. And I may add that I have tried to found my likes and dislikes on actual cosmic evidence and not on mere caprice. I know how hard it is to talk of external standards in dealing with human preferences, and would


scarcely care to call my criteria infallible ones. On the other hand I think the long biological, psychological, and philosophical explanations of these *proximate* or *pseudo-absolute standards* which I have made in former letters will convince you that they are not superficial, capriciously-adopted pieces of guesswork and prejudice. You may consider them *wrong*, but you can hardly consider them as *lightly or arbitrarily held*. That is, when I say I believe this set of standards to be profoundly more valid than some other set, it is not merely a question of mood and taste. I have thought about the other sets and tried to see what relation they have to any phase of human existence and differentiation, and in some cases have tried to believe in them. My reason for believing as I do is that all the evidence I can pick up seems, to my mind, to point that way. ..........

Price's visit must surely have been an event. He is the most versatile chap I've ever struck—and could have matched that fencing lecture with one on Arabic, mathematics, Oriental rugs, or what not ..... each as ample and scholarly as its fellows. His remarks about foot-fighting must have been interesting. I have heard of this art—which in France seems to be a science somewhat different from the hobnailed brutalities of Maine and Michigan lumberjacks. Price, by the way, is now visiting Clark Ashton Smith again, if he carried out the design mentioned in his latest card. He forms quite a connecting link in the group—being, I believe, the only outside weirdist ever met in person either by you or by the Seneschal of Averoigne. Glad you liked the Silver Key sequel—which somehow disappointed me in print. Collaboration tends to hold my imagination in check, and thus to handicap my inventiveness to a great extent. I need an absolutely free hand in composition.

I've just written an article on interplanetary fiction at the request of Crawford—of *Marvel Tales*—though it has come out so long that I doubt if he'll want to print it, after all. I try to outline—roughly—the things that could be done to drag this sort of story out of its present appalling rut of banality and conventionality—and incidentally, I venture a few remarks on weird fiction in general.

.....

Yours most cordially—  
HPL
