Dear Miss Toldridge:—

I am indeed glad that you found the Nantucket material of interest. My week there ended as pleasantly as it began—& toward the last I explored some of the environs of the town on a hired bicycle .... the first time in 20 years that I had been on a wheel. Riding was quite as easy & familiar as if I had last dismounted only the day before, & it seemed marvellously exhilarating & rejuvenating to be spinning along just as in the old times. The place is certainly all that the folders show—& more. Never had I realised that so fascinating a haven of the past could exist only 90 miles away. The secret of its distinctiveness & preservation is, of course, its insular isolation. It is a little world in itself—Daniel Webster once called it (when he went there to try some cases in the 1830's) "The Unknown City in the Sea". Nowhere else do the actual feel & substance of the past exist so perfectly & unbrokenly. I enclose a couple more cards, plus a map of the town & island which may prove interesting. The names & details on these maps can be well brought out by a reading-glass of moderate power. It was pleasant to be able to see Saturn through a good telescope. I have an astronomical telescope with 3" object-glass myself; but its portable mounting is crude, & its performances leave much to be desired. I have, however, looked through the 12" telescope of the local Ladd observatory—an adjunct of Brown University. .................

Cold weather appears here off & on now—but the steam is going idyllically 24 hours a day! During the transition period I depended on my oil stove. Sunsets still blaze—& through a framework of foliage incipiently autumnal. Getting too late for outdoor reading & writing—my last trip of that sort was Septr. 26, when I cleaned up some revision in 2 places—first on a stone wall at a high point of the Breakneck Hill Road (in my favourite countryside N. of Prov.), & then atop a rocky cliff beside a glassy tarn in the midst of deep woods. From the first site I had a marvellous vista of verdant valley & distant steepled hill. The leaves had just begun to turn—but despite the pallor of the sunlight the landscape was still predominantly aestival. Yes—the Morton who visited me in August is the one who contributed to the Washington anthology, Gabelle is a great friend of his. Cook is, I t hink, rather better, though not feeling rather energetic. Haven't seen anybody lately, though I expect a call from the brothers Wandrei as they pass through Providence in the course of their present motor tour. They are now in Montreal. Also, my host of last August in Wollaston—E. H. Cole—may come down to some week-end for Rhodinsular exploration. No—I haven't come across any interesting Providence literati, though there are such without doubt. I seem to find the most interesting persons scattered about from Vermont to Florida, Texas, & California!

Nearly sunk with wretched job of novel revision—but I'm shifting the worst of it on to someone else in sheer self-defence. Haven't had a chance for any original fiction. The only recent thing I've written is an elegy for a recently deceased member of the amateur journalist circle—a rather stilted & mediocre composition which would have been not quite so bad if I had not written it to order in a hurry for C. W. Smith. I'll enclose Smith's booklet containing it—which you needn't bother to return. The bad typography & misprints are lamentable. ..............

.................. By the way—some time ago, in answer to a request, I prepared an article for one of the amateur papers which may interest you when it comes out—an account of each of the houses in which Poe ever lived, with a description of those still standing. I'll send you a copy when it appears. Naturally, the most extensive descriptions are of the Fordham cottage & newly restored Philadelphia house which I visited last July.

With all good wishes,  
I remain  
Yrs most sincerely,  
HPLovecraft
