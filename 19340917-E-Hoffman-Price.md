Hail, Ius!

.. The element of *pure transportation* on all my trips this year—Florida, Boston, Nantucket—has not come up to fifty dollars combined .. But alas—it may be that even the 'bus trips—and still more—will have to go soon. Outgo persists, income sinks to invisibility! ..

Astaghifir, and all that!
