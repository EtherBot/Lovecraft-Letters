Dear Dr. de Castro:—

................ Permit me to wish you, with much sincerity, the traditional many happy returns. For most persons I imagine that being born is neither a calamity nor a boon—it is just an event. They are about as well off alive as dead—it doesn't make much difference. A smaller number are definitely worse off alive thant hey would be had they never been born. And a still smaller number are perhaps actual gainers in pleasure by being alive. To the universe it makes no difference whether or not organic life happens to exist on any of its planets. The incident is too trivial to be of importance—& indeed, life cannot exist for more than the briefest fraction of a planet's total existence. It is a mistake to regard the cosmos as e ither favourable to life or unfavourable to it. It is simply indifferent & unconscious. However, that forms no occasion for sorrow on man's part. Whether he has a fairly good time or a wretched time being alive depends greatly on his own skill & good sense in adapting himself to the environment within which accident has thrown him. Barring unusual external misfortunes, a man of sense can generally gain enough contentment to make existence at least no worse than non-existence. There is always pleasure in artistic expression, the acquisition of ideas, & the trace of vague expectancy inherent in any experience whose future stages are beyond fathoming.

Yrs. most sincerely,  
H.P.Lovecraft
