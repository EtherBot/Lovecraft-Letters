Home again, and on  
  the old River-bank—  
July 17, '34

Hail, Lord of Larnin'!

Your welcome holiday bulletin awaited me as I blew into the home harbour on the morning of July 10th—and amidst what a profusion of neglected tasks, piled-up periodicals, accumulated epistles, and the like did I find it! Aedepol! I'm not half straightened out even now! You last heard from me, I conceive, in antient San Augustin—where I had a delectable week amidst facades and gables half a century old when the first Pilgrim landed on Plymouth Rock. After that came two days in immortal Charleston, one in Richmond, one in Fredericksburg, two in Washington, and one in Philadelphia. ........

In decadent Manhattan I found Sonny Belknap and his parents about to leave for Ashbury Park and Ocean Grove, N. J. over the week-end; and at their invitation went along with them—arguing with the child amidst the rhythm of the broad Atlantick's waves. I had not cash enough to stay in N. Y. long, hence looked up no one else save Loveman, with whom I spent a pleasant evening. Fra Samuelus quite overwhelm'd me by making me another gift from his private musaeum—a slim conventionalised bird of carv'd and polish'd horn, with a black lacquer'd surface. It is a typical specimen of the carving of Yankee sailors in the India trade a century ago—made under the influence of Sino-Japanese craftsmanship traditions. It stands as if pois'd for flight thro' gulphs beyond the galaxy—I call it "The Bird of Space", and feel damn lucky to have it. Loveman certainly is a philanthropist!
