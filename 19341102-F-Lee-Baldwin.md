Dear Eph-L:—

... As for old de Castro—he hasn't been away from New York, but had somewhat dropped out of sight until this autumn. He never succeeds with his various financial ventures, & is now really badly off. What is more, his eyes are in dangerous shape, & his wife is an advanced tuberculosis sufferer. Now he wants Long & me to collaborate with him on various projects—to take half the profits if they succeed. Neither of us can do so just now, though we'd like to help the old boy. He is a curious character—a bit of a poseur & charletan, though perfectly honest financially. In his life of Bierce he drops himself in rather egotistically, & perpetuates several unmistakable myths. But he is really a profound scholar—graduate of Bonn & master of 7 languages—& has had published work of undoubted importance. Some of his unpublished books are probably of real value—& I surely hope he can get a collaborator even if I can't tackle the job. He is 74 years old. In the matter of Bierce's disappearance—de Castro lived in Mexico from 1922 to 1925, & had interviews with Villa & his generals in 1923. He claims to have received an account of Bierce's end from these revolutionists—but there is no reason to think this account any more correct than the other two accounts now current. In a way, all three reports are alike—so that it is pretty likely that Bierce was somehow shot by the Villistas in 1914. Bierce was 72 years old, & bored with everything. He wanted to get into some military excitement, so went to Mexico where revolution was raging. His plan, as stated to friends, was to mix in the row a bit & then go on a trip to South America. The last letters ever received from Bierce came from Chihuahua City late 1913. My friend Samuel Loveman last heard from him in September—from Washington, D. C., where he lived. he wrote: "I am going away to South America in a few weeks, & have not the faintest notion when I shall return." As for the end—Villa told old de Castro that Bierce did *not* join any army, but that he was in Chihuahua when the rebels took it. he got drunk and criticised Villa very harshly—praising Carranza in contrast. Villa didn't like this, & ordered Bierce to leave town. As he expressed it to de Castro—*"Lo hemos hecho fuera." Later an officer told de C. that Villa really arranged to have him shot outside the village—leaving his body to the vultures. This account is believed by the well-known editor R. H. Davis.
Another account is that of a newspaper man named George F. Weeks. he met a Mexican in 1918—a Dr. Malero—who claimed to have known Bierce. According to Malero Bierce joined Villa's army but got disgusted & went over to Carranza. Later he was captured by one of Villa's generals—Urbina—& was shot after his refusal to answer questions. This is the account accepted by the late George Sterling. The third account is given by a roving character named O'Reilly. He says that Bierce was treacherously murdered by some Mexican associates & burried at Sierra Mojada. And so it goes. Wildcat legends about Bierce have persisted to this day—including accounts of his participation in the World War. It is, however, almost certain that he was killed in Mexico before the middle of 1914. In september of that year the formal search for him began. I am inclined to favour the Weeks-Malero account. De Castro is an inveterate myth-maker & embroiderer, & had quarralled with Bierce. It would be just like him to doctor an account subtly enough to place Bierce in a less favourable light. But there's no telling. It will take radically new evidence to settle the fate of Bierce. De Castro's original name is Gustav Adolf Danziger—he changed it during the World War because of unpopularity of German names—taking the name of a remote Spanish ancestor. he came to America in 1886 & was a dentist for a long period. He also dabbled in politics, & was American consul at Madrid for a time. The piece of work he did with Bierce was translating the German novel fo Richard Voss—*The Monk & the Hangman's daughter*. he was German-speaking & (in 1889) could not write even passable English. Bierce, on the other hand, was a master of English but knew no German. De Castro—or Danziger—admired the Voss novel & made a very crude translation into such English as he knew. Then Bierce took the crude translation & made the present admirable English Novelette of it. It is rather amusing to reflect that Bierce & de Castro always quarralled over the chief credit for this production—both forgetting that the real author was neither of them. Undoubtedly, the *real* power in the poignant drama & stirring descriptions is that of Herr Voss of Heidelberg—neither Bierce nor de Castro being anything more than an adapter. Certainly, the book as it stands is a curious three-man job! It is not a weird tale. ...

Yrs. most cordially—Ech-Pi-El
