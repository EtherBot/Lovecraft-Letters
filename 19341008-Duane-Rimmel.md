My dear Rhi'Mhel:—

.........

I guess I have *Rhy'mal* down pat now, and I always prounced *Duane* right ... if *DW AIN* is such. Proper names often present unexpected pitfalls when one has known them only on paper. Take *Koenig* for example. I called this *Coin'-ig* and Belknap (whose name, incidentally, sounds like *Bel'-nap*—with silent k) called it *Cö'-nig*. Then somebody supposed to be a German scholar corrected us and said it ought to be *Kêr'-nig*. At this point I first had occasion to get in touch with Koenig himself by telephone. Calling up his office—and keeping the latest tip in mind—I asked the clerk for Mr. "Kêr-nig", and met only with the telephonic equivalent of a blank stare. Then light dawned at the other end. "Oh! You mean Mr. *Kay'-nig!!*" Well, that was that, When the gentleman came to the instrument I hailed him as *Kay'-nig* and received no correction, nor did he demur on a later evening when I met him face to face. So Kay'-nig I suppose it is—though I was long enough in getting to it. Belknap—who is slow to learn new ways—still says *Co'nig* quite unashamedly! Wandrei's name is pronounced *W an'-dry* (rhyming with *eye* and *pie*), though several (including myself) called it *W an'-drey* (rhyming with *pay* and *day*) until instructed. There are many names in my own ancestry which—knowing them only from genealogical charts—I probably pronounce all cockeyed. Only lately did I learn that *Rhys* (on my Welsh side) is *Reez*. I had called it *Rîss*. Local usage often varies the pronunciation of both personal and place names. Rhode Island is very conservative, and elsewhere in the U. S. We pronounce *Greenwich* as *Grinn'idge* (in N. Y. and Conn. they call it *Gren'-itch*), *Norwich* as *Norridge*, *Thames* as *Tems* (in Con, *Tames*), *Berkeley* as *Bark'ley*, *Warwick* as *War'ick*, *Olney* as *O'ney*, and so on. I was utterly astonished to learn about a decade ago that the statesman Richard Olney (of Mass.) pronounced his name *Ol'-ney* instead of *O'ney*. Such a thing would be unheard-of in Rhode Island, where the Olney (O'ney) family has flourished for three hundred years, giving its name to Olneyville (O'-ney-ville), now a part of Providence. Charleston, S. C. has some very odd name pronunciations, especially among the Huguenot descendants. Off hand, how would you pronounce *Huger, Legare, Hassel,* and *Manigault?* Well, in Charleston the respective sounds are *You-jee', Le-gree', Ha'zel,* and *Man'-i-go*. And the Dutch name *Vander Horst*, early naturalised in Charleston and repeatedly appearing in the local geography (creek, street, row, block, etc.), is rendered as a dissyllable, *Van-Drorst* or *Van-drawst,* with the syllables about evenly accented. Dialect and accent certainly vary widely in America, though not so much as in the different parts of England. Have you heard of the scientific survey of local dialects now being made by Prof. Hans Kurath of Brown University—to be incorporated into a *Linguistic Atlas of North America*? All of the U. S. and Canada will be covered eventually, and even now some surprising differences within small areas have been found. Rhode Island alone has seven or eight local speeches, varying in intonation and exact verbal usage—all these hereditary, and not including any foreign dialects. East of the bay, Block Island, South County, North of Providence, near Connecticut line, etc. etc.—all these regions show variations. Such are, of course, most marked among the old rustics. Uniform compulsory education, radio, etc. are fast ironing out these individualities, so that the large linguistic survey has been undertaken none to soon. In another generation many historic idiosyncrasies will have disappeared. All islands have strong local peculiarities. Nantucket, for example, provides a whole glossary of unique words and word-usages and pronunciations. As a whole, the speech of southern New England is closer to the ordinary cultivated speech of Great Britain (*not* the Oxford drawl and clipped speech fashionable in London for the last two or three generations) than is any other native American speech. We do not sound the *r* in words like *farm* (= fäm or fahm), *water* (= watta), *course* (= coahse), *car* (= cää or cah), etc., any more than ity is sounded in London and the south of England generally. This is also true all the way down to the Atlantic coast (except for Pennsylvania) and throughout the South (E. of the Mississippi). The *r* in these words *is* sounded in *inland* northern New England (Vermont, inner part of New Hampshire) and in northern and central N. Y. State. Also Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the West generally. The typical drawl of the South begins in southern Maryland and extends down to Florida, although it does not appear in the newer Yankee-settled Florida towns. In Georgia it has a curious thickness not found elsewhere, and west of the Mississippi it acquires Western characteristics. It has never existed in Charleston, S. C. because of the close relations of that city with England, together with its isolation from the rural hinterland. Charleston speech is much like that of Providence. Another city with a recognisable local dialect different from the surrounding country is Boston, with its broad vowels. New York City has an atrociously ugly patois of its own, with blunted vowels and an interchange of the *-er* and *-oi* sounds(thus—"The *Oil* of *Joisey* bought Stan-*Erl* stock" ... or "the critic Oinest Bird () Ernest Boyd () and explorer Boid () Byrd ()"). It is comical to hear a New Yorker say *coil* when he means *curl*, and *curl* when he means *coil!* They also have difficulty with the *-ph* sound after *s*—saying *spinx* for *sphinx* and *spear* for *sphere*. In my opinion the harshest and least likeable American dialectics are those of New York, Pennsylvania, and the Middle West. In California (and I suppose in Oregon and Washington also) there is less of the *grating* quality than there is in Ohio or Michigan or Iowa. In Illinois there are regions where New England dialect exists untainted—little linguistic islands making places where Yankees migrated en masse around 1830. One of these is the small city of Delevan in Tazewell County—settled largely by my Phillips relatives (two of my great-grand-uncles, James and Benoni Phillips, went there with large families a century ago) and other Rhode Islanders (Greene, Lawton). After more than three generations the speech of Delavan is still indistinguishable from that of Providence and Newport. Decadent idioms and corrupt pronunciations usually begin in the West or South an work East, or else in New York City, spreading in all directions. Thus the use of *like* where *as* or *as if* ought to be was first southern only. Then the West got it—and only in the last five years have the less careful people of New England picked it up. A decade ago the corrupt pronunciation of *cär'mel* (like *Mt. Carmel*) for the candy *cär'-a-mel* was never heard East of the Mississippi. It is now heard in N. Y., but never in New England. In another decade our slipshod elements will get it. On the other hand the atrocious barbarism *kew'pon* for *coupon* probably originated in New York, as did *add'ress* of *address'*. I don't know where the very recent barbarism of *coop* for *coupe'* arose, but it has reached new England.

Yrs. most cordially,  
Ech-Pi-El.
