My dear Ryé-mel:—

.......  
.... It may surprise you to know that—despite the oft-repeated fact that Rhode Island is the most densely-populated political unit in the world except Belgium—this state *has the largest proportion of woodland of any state in the union*. The secret of this paradox is that our population is all packed into the urban population centres and along the factory-lined river valleys. Beyond these areas there are miles and miles of utterly deserted countryside and deep woods. Some westerners think of the East as completely filled up and without open spaces—yet there is not a New England state in which a person couldn't wander all day without meeting any evidence of human habitation if he chose the right areas. This was less so in 1790 than today, for during the eighteenth century the farming population covered a great deal of ground. As soon as the factories appeared, however, the people began to drift towards the towns and river-valleys; leaving the back country in an increasing state of desertion. Today some of the wild animals are coming back—snakes are more abundant,  and deer are frequently seen. Now and then vague rumours of a bear or wolf appear, though there is no real evidence that any of these formidable old-timers are on deck again. But bobcats certainly are on the increase. It is curious how an age of intensive urbanisation also promotes the return of the primitive wilderness! .....

.... About the twin story(*Cassius*—by Henry S. Whitehead) I was divided between two plans of development. One would have had the monster escape as Whitehead had it—but would have had it much more terrible and much less human. I would have had it grow inside, and frighten people much more terribly than *Cassius* did. Indeed, I would have tried to convey the implication that some Outside force or daemon had taken possession of the brainless, twisted body—impelling it to strange acts of *apparently deliberate but plainly non-human motivation*. The climax would have consisted of some dramatic and unmistakable revelation of this Outside tenancy—probably connected with the spectacular destruction of the thing in one way or another. My story would have had none of the lightness, suavity, and humour of Whitehead's, but would have been grim and terrible all through. So much for *one* plot. The other plot I had in mind was much more human—not supernatural at all, in fact. This idea was to have the connection of the man and his miniature twin *much more complex and obscure* than any doctor had suspected. The operation of separation is performed—but lo! An unforeseen horror and tragedy results. For it seems *that the brain of the twin-burdened man lay in the miniature twin alone* .... so that the operation had produced *a hideous monster only a foot tall, with the keen brain of a man, and a handsome man-like shell with the undeveloped brain of a total idiot*. From this situation I planned to develop an appropriate plot, although—from the magnitude of the task—I had not progressed very far. I had an idea of having the midget monster assume the guardianship of his handsome, brainless twin and endeavour to hypnotise it in such a way that it could do his talking for him and act as his substitute in the outside world. I meant to have him succeed, so that after about a year there appears in society a handsome, brilliant man *who always carries a satchel, and who displays vast alarm when there is any danger of his being separated from it*. This, of course, is the brainless twin—who now serves are the mouthpiece and exterior facade of the intelligent monster, who rules him by hypnotism from the shelter of the satchel. From then on I had decided nothing. One idea was to have an accident destroy the satchel, causing the idiot to collapse helplessly and perhaps die. Another was to have the man gain fame—but finally to have the idiot body die in such a way that the death can hardly be concealed. The intelligent twin still lives—but how can he now keep his secret? He may be able to hide bodily, but how can he continue the work which brought him fame (say as a writer or painter or scholar) when the famous man is supposed to be dead? I had not progressed to the point of solving that problem—or even deciding wether I'd have such a problem—when Whitehead began urging the collaboration and I finally gave him the plot to develop in his own way. Hence *Cassius*. Now—after years—*another* alternative occurs to me. I might have the death of the handsome idiot-body concealed, and have the intelligent monster embalm it and display it seated in a chair—ostensibly still alive but paralyzed. He could have it appear to speak—in a feeble, alien voice supposedly due to paralysis—through the clever practice of ventriloquism. Then some awful climax or revelation could occur—any one of a dozen hideous sorts. The embalming could be *imperfect*, so that the supposedly living man would display signs of decomposition. Or notice could be attracted to its failure to age through the passing years. In writing such a story, I'd probably *begin near the end*—that is, having the bulk of the action concern the final phase, when the supposed paralytic begins to arouse suspicion. The antecedent history—the operation etc.—would be subtly worked in as back-flashes. I would make the revelation very gradual and suspense-filled—and at the last might leave the reader in some doubt of what the truth really was. Whether I shall ever do this or not remains to be seen. It certainly wouldn't be duplicating *Cassius*—for the whole spirit and emphasis of my conception is antipodally alien to Whitehead's. Whitehead urged me to go ahead and try—but I thought some time had better elapse in any case. I believe I mentioned that my idea came from seeing an actual case of the underdeveloped-twin anomaly in a freak show (Hubert's Museum in W. 42nd St.) in New York. The main in question—an intelligent Italian who for some reason billed himself under the French name of "Jean Libera"—had a little anthropoid excrescence growing out of his abdomen which looked hellishly gruesome when uncovered. Clothed, he looked merely like a somewhat "pot-bellied" individual. So fart as I know, he is still living and on exhibition. He looked so essentially refined and high-grade that I wondered at his willingness to be exploited as a freak, and speculated as to what he would do if a stroke of luck removed him from the need of such an ignominious occupation. The first thing he would do, I argued, would be to have the excrescence cut off—and then and there the idea of the story came. This was in 1924 or 1925. Now the odd and amusing thing is this. Years afterward—after I had give the idea to Whitehead and was awaiting the appearance of *Cassius*—I chanced to mention the matter to my old friend Arthur Leeds of New York, who has had the extensive dealings with freaks and other amusement enterprises. Fancy my surprise when he told me that he knows Libera well—that the man's real name is *Giovanni* Libera, that he is an Italian of great intelligence, that he is interested in everything *weird*, and that (believe this or not—it's actual truth!!) he is especially fond of *my* work in *Weird Tales!!!!* Talk about concidence! Leeds was going to tell him about *Cassius*, but I told him not to, since he might feel some delicacy (despite his occupation) about being used in that way. At the time (1930) Leeds was going to introduce me to Libera; but something prevented, so the meeting never came off. It certainly would have seemed off to meet one of my plot-germs in the flesh .... the flesh of two bodies, or a body and a half, at that!

Yrs. most sincerely,
