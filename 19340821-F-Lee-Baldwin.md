My dear Baldwin:—

..... As for my newly-acquired *Bird of Space* ... he looks something like this—standing about a foot tall. He is carved out of a piece of horn—I don't know of what animal, though the colour is black—& highly polished & lacquered on the exterior. Wings & feathers—as well as eyes—are suggested through some very delicate engraving. The posture of the bird—as if looking into the sky preparatory to a hop-off for unknown trans-galactic reaches—combined with its generally weird aspect to suggest the title *Bird of Space*. I am told that this object represents a type of carving common over a century ago among American sailors on ships trading in the Far East. The Sino-Japanese influence is so strong that there is little doubt who the sailors' teachers were. I've put the Bird on the top of a new low bookcase in company with a Japanese idol & a Kim Ling vase. Loveman was amazingly generous to give me this object. I had admired it for years in his home, but never thought of hinting for it. On the last night of my visit we fell to talking about it, & as I left he pressed it into my hands as a final thunderbolt surprise. That's just like him! Some time I mean to take a photograph of this & other objects in my "museum"—and when I do I'll send you prints. I have an Egyptian ushabti, Mayan images, & other odd & curious things. .....

.... It's only comparatively recently that I've realised how many Hollanders have immigrated to the Northwestern & North Middle West. When I think of a Dutch-American, I still think first of the old 17th Century New Netherland stock, from which my friend Wilfred B. Talman is descended. I did, though, realise that a more recent Dutch element exists in Michigan & Wisconsin. One of this group now living in Providence (though I haven't met him in person) is the poet & novelist David Cornel de Jong. It is rather singular that members of the different northern European nations have a different appearance (as some undoubtedly do, though others don't), since they all belong largely to the same basic race-stock. I suppose the causes are varied—differences in diet & climate, differences in individual settlement (i. e., by chance, certain types of the many shades of physiognomy prevailing throughout any race predominated amongst the settlers of some specific region), & partial amalgamation with different types of settlement. The last-named cause is probably the most potent; for in the various realms of its wide wandering & settlement our common Nordic stock has met & mixed with races as far apart as the Mongoloid (Lapp-Finn), Slavonic, Mediterranean element is very strong—giving rise to the "Black Irish" type, & to the dark , short, people of Wales & southern England generally. It is curious how much more primitive & persistent the brunet type is than the blond. Introduce a little blond blood amongst a brunet population, & it is wholly lost in two or three generations—as in the case of Italy, which has swallowed up thousands of yellow-haired Celts & Teutons without leaving a trace of them. On the other hand, a little brunet blood can quickly darken half or ¾ of any vast blond population amongst whom it is introduced. There are extremely few blond Italians, Greeks, or Spaniards—&yet there are as many brunets as blonds in all the Northern races. British blood has had many odd accessions through the heterogeneous followers of the Conqueror. Also—it contains all the varied elements added to the aboriginal stocks by the diversely recruited Roman legions.

The Germans—especially those of the South & East—have vast amounts of Slavonic blood due to the slow westward filtration if Wendish elements the Prussians are also strongly Slavic—though in their case the Slavonic blood is the original element, the Teutonic coming later. The language called "Old Prussian" is a Slavic dialect. All of the tongues of Europe, however, (except the Lapp, Finn & Magyar descendants of Mongol speech, & the absolutely unclassifiable Basque or Pyrenees) are more or less remotely derived from the speech of the Nordic or Aryan race, showing how powerful it must have been in ancient times as distinguished from all the others. Paradoxically, this original Aryan speech has been retained most closely by a branch whose *blood* has been the most mixed with alien stocks—i. e., the Hindoo. The purest blood representatives of the old race are probably the Scandinavians—especially those of Iceland, where the only mixture has been with Irish Celts of a not dissimilar basic origin. One of the great puzzles of Northern ethnology is the origin of the peculiar facial & cranial type associated with the Gaelic Celt of western Ireland & Northern Scotland—the type with upturned nose, long upper lip, heavy eyebrow-ridges, &c. This type has no known analogue anywhere else in the world, & the ethnologist is at a loss to determine how it arose. The races entering into the composition of the Gaels must have been largely Nordic, with a touch perhaps of the Alpine (Slav) & Mediterranean. Whence, then, came this peculiar physiognomy? Was there some unknown aboriginal stock in the British Isles of which history has retained no trace? A lesser puzzle—& of a somewhat negative nature—lies within the modern mixture of the Anglo-Saxon race; i. e., why have certain types of physiognomy common in Great Britain failed to reproduce themselves among the purely British stock of the United States? The key to this riddle probably lies in the marked regional variations in the British population, & in the fact that the East Anglian countries (with a purely Saxon basis) were overwhelmingly predominant in the colonial immigration—thus creating a local American type not representative of the whole of Britain. The Celtic element typical of southern & western England is especially lacking in the typical Yankee—as is also the dark Cockney type derived from urban London. ...

All good wishes—Yrs. most sincerely—HPL
