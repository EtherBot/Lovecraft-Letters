Dear Malik:—

....  
.. Another thing with an Oriental touch which might interest you is the exhibit of Cambodian stone sculpture and Javanese works and puppets at Faunce House—on the Brown campus a block from here. I'll chuck in a catalogue which you needn't bother to return. This, of course, isn't in your Islamic line—but at least it has something to do with the general region represented by Pawang Ali. I don't care for Indo-Chinese, Malaysian, or Hindoo art, but the whole epic of the Khmers, with their brooding, deserted city of Angkor, has always fascinated me. It is curious to note the elongated ear-lobes of Cambodian statues—a link in common with the baffling colossi of Easter Island. I fancy a wave of Indo-Chinese culture spread all the way across the Pacific—entering central America and giving many characteristic touches to Mayan and Aztec art. This would account for the puzzling resemblances to old-world forms noted in certain American antiquities. The idea of an "Atlantis" is really quite cockeyed, for all the evidence is against the existence of such a bridge to Europe during the age of man. Whatever European-Asian-African cultural influences reached America undoubtedly came by way of the Pacific—in which large land areas may or may not have subsided during the human period. A curious thing about these Cambodian statues is the archaic way of depicting hair—by thickly studded raised dots. This is characteristic of *archaic* Greek art, but disappeared in Greece by 500 B. C. In Asia, on the other hand, it kept right on through the centuries.
